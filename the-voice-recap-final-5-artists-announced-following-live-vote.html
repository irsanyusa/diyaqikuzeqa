Ahead of the night, the show’s host, Carson Daly explained that tonight’s episode will feature a 5-minute voting period at the end of the two hour episode. Now, voting is closed, and season 23’s Top 5 has been determined.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-top-8-impresses-during-live-semifinal-show>The Top 8 Impresses During Live Semifinal Show</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Team Niall</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryley Tate Wilson</a> kicked off the night, performing a heartfelt version of “Vienna” by Billy Joel. In this performance, the 15 year old artist really came to life. After performing from behind the microphone for multiple weeks, he impressed by playing the piano.</p><p>The second, but not forgotten Team Niall member, Gina Miles, impressed with a powerful rendition of “All I Want” by Kodaline. Since last episode, Gina has really begun shining on stage. This song was definitely performed well.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>excuse us… how does Gina Miles do that……..??? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xLQ85Dj46E</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>May 16, 2023</a><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Team Chance</h3><p>Ray Uriel went next, singing “Can You Stand The Rain” by New Edition. This wasn’t my favorite performance of Ray’s. Although he handled the live performance like a champ, I didn’t love the song itself.</p><p>Team Chance’s final artists, trio Sorelle, came into the round with a new rendition of “Fallin'” by Alicia Keys. Since this isn’t traditionally a group song, I was really impressed with how they arranged the piece.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>a little bit of <a href=#>@MABSorelle</a> pixie dust for your monday <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vPK6eJ4UR6</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>May 16, 2023</a><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Team Kelly</h3><p>After working with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reba McEntire</a> herself, Holly Brand, with the help of Kelly Clarkson, chose to dive into McEntire’s catalogue. During her semifinal performance, she performed “Rumor Has It” by McEntire. Holly did an amazing job on this song.</p><p>Later, D.Smooth took the stage, singing “Thinking Out Loud” by Ed Sheeran. This song was such a good choice for D.Smooth, since it showed off his versatility. If we’ve learned anything from this season, it’s that D.Smooth is able to sing almost any genre, smoothly.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>obsessed with that <a href=#>@Thereal_dsmooth</a> <a href=#>@edsheeran</a> moment <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jF7YtMvFqC</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>May 16, 2023</a><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Team Blake</h3><p>NOVIAS performed “Skyfall” by Adele. Although NOIVAS has been a clear frontrunner this season, this song wasn’t a great choice for him. He hit all the notes and rhythms okay, but finally shined at the most powerful moment of the song. I was so used to him shining throughout the performance from his others, so it was weird to wait for it.</p><p>The final contestant performance of the night featured Shelton’s Country artist, Grace West. The artist debuted Tammy Wynette’s “‘Til I Can Make it On My Own” during her live performance. This performance may have had the loudest applause after the fact.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>country magic forever !!! <a href=#>@gracewestmusic</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CJjt6Iz60s</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>May 16, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Which Artists Are in The Top 5?</h2><p>After performances by Niall Horan and Chance The Rapper, the Top 8 artists took the stage for results. Saved artists are Grace West (Team Blake), D.Smooth (Team Kelly), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gina Miles</a> (Team Niall), Sorelle (Team Chance), and NOIVAS (Team Blake).</p><p>The Voice finale performances broadcast live on Monday, May 22 at 8 p.m. ET. On Tuesday night, fans will see a one hour special (from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET) ahead of the live results show. This one hour special is called the Live Cutdown Show. According to the episode’s description, artists will relive their final performances as they sing one last time. A-list guests and the final artists are “checking in” before appearing in the finale.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_CGTJudges_SemiFinals_CityTV_CGT-220x147.jpg alt="‘Canada’s Got Talent’ Judges Reveal What it Takes to Win The Show [EXCLUSIVE]" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Semifinals</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedGempqoXZu2r63LZmxmmaKptrTA0maYp6afqrukscNmnaiknKTEqrrGZqOirpViw7DAxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./0-28804-2107768-2107767-2107766-00-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dixie Chicks, Entertainment Weekly - Top 10 Nude Magazine Covers: From Kim Kardashian to Lennon</span></a>
