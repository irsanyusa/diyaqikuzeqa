Deuteronomy 28:11–12</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>“And the Lord shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the Lord swore unto thy fathers to give thee."</strong></p><p><strong>“The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.”</strong></p><p>This scripture offers a powerful message of hope and encouragement. It reassures us that obedience to God's commandments can lead to a life marked by divine provision, abundance, and financial stability. For those facing financial challenges, these verses serve as a reminder that God desires to bless and prosper His people in all areas of their lives, including their finances. The key takeaway is to align your life and actions with God's will, remain faithful in stewardship, and trust in God's timing for provision and breakthrough.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>2. Deuteronomy 28:6</h3></p><p><strong>“You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out.”</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This scripture offers a profound assurance of continuous blessing for those who live according to God's commandments. It signifies a life enveloped in God's favor, where every entrance and exit—symbolic of all life's endeavours—is met with God's blessings. For you seeking a financial breakthrough, this verse encourages faithfulness and obedience to God, promising that such a lifestyle will attract blessings not just financially but in all aspects of life. The promise of being "blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out" reminds us of God's constant presence and support, ensuring success and protection in your pursuits and financial endeavours. It emphasises the holistic nature of God's blessings, assuring that God's favour surrounds His followers in every situation, providing a strong foundation for financial stability and growth.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>3. Romans 8:32</h3></p><p><strong>“He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?”</strong></p><p>Romans 8:32 is like saying, "If God was willing to give us the biggest gift ever—His own Son—don't you think He'll give us everything else we need, too?" It's a way of showing that if God did the hardest thing by letting Jesus come to earth for us, He's definitely not going to hold back on helping us out with our needs, including money troubles. So, when you're worried about cash or getting the things you need, this verse is like a reminder that God's got your back, because He's already given the biggest proof of His love and support.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>4. Proverbs 10:22</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>“The blessing of the Lord brings wealth, without painful toil for it.”</strong></p><p>This verse is basically saying that when God decides to bless you, He can make you rich without all the crazy hard work and stress that usually comes with trying to make money. It's like when you get a really cool gift that you didn't have to do anything for; it just lands in your lap because someone thought you should have it. This verse tells us that sometimes, the best things, including money, come our way simply because God wants us to have them. It’s a reminder not to stress too much about hustling 24/7 because some of the best blessings come easy when they’re from God.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-17>5. Psalm 68:19</h3></p><p><strong>“Blessed be the Lord, who daily loads us with benefits, the God of our salvation!”</strong></p><p>This verse is saying, "Big shoutout to God, who every single day sends us awesome stuff, and is all about saving us!" Imagine God as the best friend who doesn't just help you out once in a while but actually surprises you with cool gifts every day. These aren't just any gifts; they're exactly what you need, when you need them, like finding money when you're short on cash or getting some help right when you're stressing over something big. It's like God's got this never-ending stash of good things He's ready to drop on us, not just to make life easier, but also to remind us He's looking out for us, especially when it comes to tough stuff like needing a financial boost. It’s a reminder that God’s got our back, always ready with whatever we need to get through the day.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>6. Psalms 145:16</h3></p><p><strong>“Thou openest thine hand, and satisfies the desire of every living thing.”</strong></p><p>Picture this: God's like the ultimate giver, always ready to dish out what we need or really want, just by opening His hand. It's as if He's got this endless supply of goodies and is more than happy to share them with us, whether it's something big like a financial win when we're tight on money, or something smaller but still super important. This verse is a cool reminder that whatever we're hoping for, especially when we're praying for a financial breakthrough, God's got the power to make it happen. It's all about trusting that He knows what we need and when we need it, and He's always on time with His help</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-24>7. Philippians 4:19</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>“And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.”</strong></p><p>In this verse, God is promising you that no matter what you need, whether it's money to get through a tough spot or just some support when things are rough, God has an endless supply. He's ready to help out, not with just the daily 2k, but with everything, based on how incredibly rich and generous He is. It's a reminder that when you're worried about not having enough, God's like, "I've got this," and He's willing to help out big time.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-27>8. Job 22:21</h3></p><p>“<strong>Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way, prosperity will come to you.”</strong></p><p>This verse says that if you get on the same page with God, really tuning in and following His lead, you're setting yourself up for a win. It's like getting the inside scoop on the best way to handle your life, including your finances. Being at peace with God isn't just about feeling calm; it's like having a secret strategy that can lead to prosperity, or in other words, getting to a place where you're not stressing about money because you're covered. It's a heads-up that playing by God's rules can actually set you up for some pretty awesome rewards.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-30>9. 2 Corinthians 9:9–11</h3></p><p><strong>“As it is written: “He has scattered abroad His gifts to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.” Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your store of seed and will increase the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in every way to be generous on every occasion…”</strong></p><p>2 Corinthians 9:9-11 is like a pep talk about being generous and how that triggers a cool kind of karma with blessings. It starts off with, "As it is written: 'He has freely scattered His gifts to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.'" This is basically about giving without holding back, because when you do, you're doing something truly awesome.</p><p>Then it moves on to talk about how God's got this way of making sure that when you give, you're not left empty-handed. Instead, you get even more back so you can keep being generous.</p><p>Verse 11 wraps it up by saying that when you're generous, you're not just helping others and getting blessings in return, but you're also giving people reasons to be thankful. So, when you're hoping for a financial breakthrough, remember that being generous and helping others can actually lead to more blessings coming your way. It’s about that cycle of giving, receiving, and creating lots of thankfulness all around.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-35>10. Joel 2:18–19</h3></p><p><strong>“Then the Lord will be zealous for His land, And pity His people. The Lord will answer and say to His people,“Behold, I will send you grain and new wine and oil, And you will be satisfied by them; I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.”</strong></p><p>These verses are basically about hope and recovery. They’re saying that even if things have been super tough, if you turn back to God and genuinely seek Him, He’s ready to restore what was lost and then some. It’s a reminder that no situation is too dire for a turnaround, especially when God’s involved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cK7Im6OeZaaav7Sx0madqKpdm7avrc2coJqkXZe%2Fpq3KrZ%2Brp6WctXCA2bKkaZ6c</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./september.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened on September 23, 1957</span></a>
