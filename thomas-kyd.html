After finishing school, Kyd did not go to university; instead he is thought to have become a scrivener like his father.</p><p>In the early 1590s, Kyd shared a room with another playwright, Christopher Marlowe. In 1593, Kyd was arrested and accused of writing papers against the church. During this time, he accused his roommate of not believing in God and Marlowe was killed shortly after being questioned about this.</p><p>Kyd was released from prison but had trouble finding work as a writer afterward. His last play, "Cornelia,” was published in early 1594 and later that year, at the age of 35, Kyd died.</p><p>After his death, Kyd was largely forgotten for a long time. It was not until the 1700s and 1800s that scholars rediscovered his work and his influence was finally recognized.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>November 6</a>, <a href=#>1558</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> London, England<br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Scorpio</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>July 16</a>, <a href=#>1594</a> (aged 35)<br></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1593-05-18</a> Playwright Thomas Kyd's accusations of heresy lead to an arrest warrant for Christopher Marlowe</li></ul><h2>References</h2><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Playwrights</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwwMeopJqrXaDGpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-fans-vienna-streets-terrorist-attack-canceled-concert-1236100439.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Fans Sing in Vienna Streets After Canceled Eras Tour Concert: Swifties Are Res</span></a>
