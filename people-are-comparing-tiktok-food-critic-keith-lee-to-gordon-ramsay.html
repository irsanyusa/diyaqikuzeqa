The TikTok star was honest about the service he received at restaurants such as The Real Milk and Honey and Old Lady Gang (owned by Kandi Burress). According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>, Lee has received backlash and threats for his videos.</p><p>“There was so much positive in Atlanta that was shunned by the negative,” Lee said in a video. “I’m going to be 100 percent honest. If you want me to come, please understand I will be honest.”&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid being recognized and given special treatment, Lee sends his family into restaurants first. At both of the aforementioned restaurants, employees offered to seat him before other guests when they realized he was there. He declined.</p><p>“I’m going to be 100 percent transparent, 100 percent candid, me and my family will postpone touring if other cities are going to be like this,” Lee said of how his Atlanta experience affected him. “Every review [is] not going to be the best.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FANS MAKE FUN OF GORDON RAMSAY AFTER HE SHARES ‘BEST ADVICE’</a></strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>So when Gordon Ramsey went around telling restaurants they suck, it was “entertainment”.
