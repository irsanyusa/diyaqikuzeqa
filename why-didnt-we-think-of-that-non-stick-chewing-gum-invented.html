 When you were a kid, did you ever have to use peanut butter to get gum out of your hair? The next generation may not have to deal with the embarrassment.
Designers at Bristol University in the U.K. have come up with a non-stick chewing gum. According to their tests on roads and sidewalks, more than 50% of their gum, called Rev7, can be removed through traditional street cleaning."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

According to their tests on roads and sidewalks, more than 50% of their gum, called Rev7, can be removed through traditional street cleaning. The water-soluble gum contains a special polymer to make it less sticky, which means it can easily be removed from clothing with soap and water,<a href=#> the Telegraph reports</a>.</p><p>And lest you think that means the gum won’t taste as good, the company that produced the gum says it has the same taste and texture as your typical stick, and comes in peppermint and spearmint.</p><p>The British government spends 150 million pounds a year cleaning up gum from the streets. If Rev7 catches on, the U.K. could avoid becoming like Singapore, where chomping on gum could land you in jail for a year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAp7HEnWWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWlgZH5xe49uZrCgqWKxqrDNrWSwnV2ptaq6ymamn2Wkna61ec2opWarpJ6wrHnCoZywoZ6ceqjBzGagp66Vo8GmsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./star-fox-zero-review.html><span>←</span><span>Star Fox Zero Review: Nintendo's Divisive New Shooter</span></a>
