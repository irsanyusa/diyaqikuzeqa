But just like people from other professions, they often have to&nbsp;deal with different problems. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;show a&nbsp;new film to&nbsp;the world, they have to&nbsp;solve a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;issues and adapt to&nbsp;the ever-changing industry.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> want to&nbsp;share the amazement we&nbsp;felt when we&nbsp;read these 11&nbsp;unexpected movie facts that’ll surprise even the most experienced viewers.</p><p><h2>1. Bad guys don’t use Apple products.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d7/43f/2b410d573aaf1fd964c2bba922.jpg><p>American director Rian Johnson, who recently made Knives Out, <a href=#>talked</a> about a&nbsp;funny detail in&nbsp;his film, and in&nbsp;the movie industry as&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole, that can help the viewers understand who the bad guys are in&nbsp;any movie. Bad guys will never have an&nbsp;<a href=# title=Apple data-link=tag>Apple</a> product in&nbsp;their hands. The company allows creators to&nbsp;use their devices under one condition: the devices have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used by&nbsp;the good guys only.</p><p>Apple has been the <a href=#>leader</a> in&nbsp;product-placement in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> films. Since 2012, iPhones and other products from the company are only shown in&nbsp;a&nbsp;positive light in&nbsp;movies.</p><p><h2>2. In&nbsp;the past, 3D-films made people dizzy more often than today.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/258/c6d/6d031b56c2b88187773d3a3f21.jpg><p>Today, when producing 3D-movies, creators avoid the effect of&nbsp;having something fly right at&nbsp;you. The thing&nbsp;is, our brains don’t understand that the pictures we&nbsp;see are just an&nbsp;illusion. The eyes <a href=#>try</a> to&nbsp;react as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were real physical objects. But in&nbsp;the end, the brain just tenses up&nbsp;the eye muscles, which leads to&nbsp;dizziness, headache, and nausea.</p><p>So, lately, special effects artists have tried to&nbsp;make movies so&nbsp;that 3D-objects just fly by&nbsp;very fast and the brain has no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;them, or&nbsp;they use small particles (like dust, ash, or&nbsp;snow) that the brain sees as&nbsp;noise and doesn’t focus&nbsp;on.</p><p><h2>3. The children starring in&nbsp;horror films often don’t know what the film is&nbsp;about.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3cf/051/ff5ea251fcb5d47b09df81936e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;most cases, the children in&nbsp;horror films have no&nbsp;idea that they are acting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;horror film. The shooting is&nbsp;rarely done in&nbsp;chronological order and it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;very hard for a&nbsp;child to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;solid picture of&nbsp;what happens in&nbsp;the film. There is&nbsp;nothing scary on&nbsp;the set either: the music and the sounds are added in&nbsp;post-production and all the costumes, masks, dummies, and other things look funny, rather than scary in&nbsp;real life.</p><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;the scenes where children have to&nbsp;deal with blood or&nbsp;something really scary, this is&nbsp;made to&nbsp;look like a&nbsp;game. Danny Lloyd, the boy from The Shining, had no&nbsp;idea he&nbsp;was working on&nbsp;a&nbsp;horror film. Stanley Kubrick <a href=#>decided to&nbsp;not tell him the story</a>. Danny thought it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;drama about a&nbsp;family that lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hotel.</p><p><h2>4. Movie trailers are not made by&nbsp;movie companies, they’re made by&nbsp;advertising agencies.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;2-minute trailer for a&nbsp;film, directors hire special companies. It&nbsp;seems that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;easier and cheaper to&nbsp;<a href=#>make</a> the people who shot the movie create the trailer. But in&nbsp;fact, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not that simple.</p><p>Most of&nbsp;the time, directors know that they are not very good at&nbsp;marketing and they have no&nbsp;idea how to&nbsp;sell a&nbsp;film to&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific target audience. So, they decide to&nbsp;hire professionals and not take the risk.</p><p><h2>5. The sound of&nbsp;broken bones in&nbsp;thrillers is&nbsp;the sound of&nbsp;carrots and celery breaking.</h2></p><p>When the sound editors need a&nbsp;sound similar to&nbsp;breaking bones, they break carrots and celery. So, the next time you <a href=#>watch</a> a&nbsp;violent scene in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie, think about these poor vegetables.</p><p><h2>6. The scenes with mirrors are some of&nbsp;the most difficult ones to&nbsp;make.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c3/a91/a6972f529592e1760e7ea4d3ba.jpg><p>The scenes near mirrors have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;made from special angles so&nbsp;that the person and their reflection are visible but the camera and the lights are not. For example, in&nbsp;Terminator&nbsp;2, they decided to&nbsp;<a href=#>use</a> stuntmen and dummies.</p><p>In&nbsp;the episode where Linda Hamilton’s character removes a&nbsp;microchip from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s head, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;mirror: in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the camera, you can see Schwarzenegger with a&nbsp;stunt double doing something with his head. And Linda is&nbsp;right next to&nbsp;the camera with a&nbsp;dummy. Movie magic at&nbsp;its best!</p><p><h2>7. Sometimes, directors make bloopers on&nbsp;purpose.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a58/37b/c0a2f057a2b3469cc2c3ecaf3e.jpg><p>Many famous blockbusters have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;bloopers. And some of&nbsp;them seem too obvious. For example, during the stock exchange scene in&nbsp;The Dark Knight Rises, Batman enters a&nbsp;tunnel during the day and exits it&nbsp;in&nbsp;complete darkness.</p><p>The thing&nbsp;is, very often, directors <a href=#>know</a> about these plot holes and they make them on&nbsp;purpose. Batman looks more epic and impressive in&nbsp;darkness, rather than in&nbsp;daylight. And for director Christopher Nolan, this was a&nbsp;good enough reason. Besides, the creators know that most of&nbsp;the viewers will be&nbsp;very interested in&nbsp;the story and they won’t notice these details.</p><p><h2>8. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;special company that provides snow for Hollywood films.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7bf/660/39025b538399ea383c6dc244e1.jpg><p>The snow used in&nbsp;Hollywood films is&nbsp;artificial. In&nbsp;almost all cases, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;provided by&nbsp;a&nbsp;company called Snow Business. The company was opened in&nbsp;1983 and its portfolio includes about 200<a href=#> different kinds of&nbsp;snow</a>.</p><p>Real snow is&nbsp;very difficult to&nbsp;deal with in&nbsp;the shooting process because it&nbsp;melts under the cameras. But some movies were actually filmed in&nbsp;snowy areas. For example, <a href=#>The Revenant </a>was shot at&nbsp;a&nbsp;ski resort in&nbsp;Canada.</p><p><h2>9. If&nbsp;extras look into the camera, they could be&nbsp;fired.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b8/8aa/a68a5f521cb5e7fb2ef704bf4a.jpg><p>Extras can’t <a href=#>look directly</a> into the camera and they can even be&nbsp;fired for this. Besides, the extras that look even remotely like the main characters won’t have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;screen time. Also, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;recommended that they not wear white clothes or&nbsp;clothes that have big captions, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;not take the attention away from the main focus of&nbsp;the scene.</p><p><h2>10. In&nbsp;movies, they rarely use real food.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dee/f20/db37f45b1a890980564cbb59ea.jpg><p>Very often, the food that appears in&nbsp;films is&nbsp;actually made of&nbsp;inedible materials. Do&nbsp;you remember the foods that you saw in&nbsp;the Great Hall in&nbsp;the Harry Potter movies? The thing&nbsp;is, the food was only real in&nbsp;the first film. It&nbsp;spoiled really quickly, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;replaced over and over again. In&nbsp;the next movies, most of&nbsp;the foods were <a href=#>made</a> of&nbsp;resin.</p><p><h2>11. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reason why the background has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;green for creating special effects.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14f/d46/460fb95d16b81916465a9d0755.jpg><p>When creating special effects, directors use the bright green colored background because the color is&nbsp;as&nbsp;far from the colors of&nbsp;the human eye as&nbsp;possible. If&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor’s eyes are green, they can use a&nbsp;blue background. Also, the character, the accessories, and all the props won’t be&nbsp;green in&nbsp;the scenes shot with this background. This trick helps to&nbsp;significantly <a href=#>reduce</a> the time it&nbsp;takes to&nbsp;edit the scenes.</p><p>Have you ever seen something in&nbsp;movies that was absolutely mind-blowing and you had no&nbsp;idea how it&nbsp;was done?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yecyoraKdXam%2Fqq%2FKrGSerpWnxm6wyKucnKyfp3qsus6wqmaZkqTCtXnBrqtmrpmaxKa%2B0mabqKakYoR6gpNqaGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-art-of-optimism.html><span>←</span><span>The Art of Optimism | Time</span></a>
