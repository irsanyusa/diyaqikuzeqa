While it’s normal to&nbsp;have highs and lows in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship, it’s also wise to&nbsp;know when it’s time to&nbsp;let&nbsp;go. But oftentimes, leaving is&nbsp;easier said than done.</p><p>With that in&nbsp;mind, we&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;deep dive into the <a href=# title=psychology data-link=tag>psychology</a> behind some of&nbsp;the reasons why people stay in&nbsp;toxic and unhealthy relationships that were over a&nbsp;long time ago. Also, be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;not miss the stories from internet users about their experience dealing with destructive relationships in&nbsp;the bonus section.</p><p><h2>1. Being scared of&nbsp;loneliness</h2></p><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a>, the fear of&nbsp;being alone can make people stay in&nbsp;destructive relationships, for the simple reason that it’s “better” to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;imperfect partner than be&nbsp;single. Society can sometimes make people think being single or&nbsp;“alone” is&nbsp;a&nbsp;negative thing&nbsp;— but in&nbsp;reality, there is&nbsp;<strong>absolutely nothing wrong with&nbsp;it.</strong></p><p><h2>2. Having low self-esteem</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b78/9de/c8ba92561e9d026712bd83a245.jpg><p><a href=#>Studies</a> also suggest that people who have low self-esteem have a&nbsp;tendency to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;unhealthy relationships. After experiencing abuse and toxic behavior for so&nbsp;long, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;easy for people to&nbsp;fall into the trap of&nbsp;<a href=#>believing</a> that they’re at&nbsp;fault for their partner’s toxic behaviors. Low self-esteem may also make people <a href=#>question</a> their own worth and what they bring to&nbsp;the relationship.</p><p><h2>3. Feeling personally responsible for their partner and their actions</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e93/6ac/413fb4530bb2a1aafd39564b9e.jpg><p>After an&nbsp;unpleasant situation or&nbsp;confrontation, an&nbsp;abuser will sometimes turn it&nbsp;around and make their partner feel guilty or&nbsp;like they are somehow at&nbsp;fault, <strong>even though they aren’t</strong>. This is&nbsp;commonly known as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>gaslighting</a>.</p><p>This behavior often develops <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>gradually</a>, thus making it&nbsp;difficult for a&nbsp;person to&nbsp;realize it’s happening. Feeling anxiety, confusion, and the inability to&nbsp;trust yourself and your actions are all <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>signs</a> of&nbsp;gaslighting.</p><p><h2>4. Believing that things might change</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae8/e3f/72260154eea69930c4d3136549.jpg><p>Many people who are in&nbsp;toxic relationships sometimes stick around because they love their partner and believe that things will <a href=#>improve</a> someday or&nbsp;that the relationship can be&nbsp;<a href=#>salvaged</a>. They may also assume that their partner’s unhealthy behavior is&nbsp;the result of&nbsp;difficult circumstances, or&nbsp;that they can somehow change the relationship by&nbsp;being a&nbsp;better partner themselves. But in&nbsp;reality, the behavior often only gets worse over time and people just get more and more <a href=#>damaged</a>.</p><p><h2>5. Being afraid of&nbsp;rejection</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/be4/c89/4ca0d75af29275890e71ee64f8.jpg><p>Another reason is&nbsp;rejection&nbsp;— they stay in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unhealthy relationship because they are <strong>scared of&nbsp;being rejected</strong> in&nbsp;the future, so&nbsp;they latch onto their current partner. People who are afraid of&nbsp;rejection <a href=#>can have</a> a&nbsp;hard time expressing themselves, expressing their thoughts, and standing up&nbsp;for themselves.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Personal experiences from internet users about their past toxic relationships</h2></p><ul><li>“I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;toxic relationship for a&nbsp;long time. When I’d finally had enough, I&nbsp;knew that if&nbsp;I didn’t remove myself from the situation as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;I&nbsp;could, then&nbsp;I would just end up&nbsp;going back. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;moved across the country. But every time&nbsp;I felt bad, I&nbsp;thought: Yes, I’m miserable, but I’m also not being treated like garbage by&nbsp;someone claiming to&nbsp;love&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;left to&nbsp;get away from that.<br>It’s been years since then and I’m doing a&nbsp;lot better. I&nbsp;got some therapy, processed a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;stuff, and now I’m a&nbsp;lot <strong>happier</strong>. And <strong>I’m <a href=# title=glad data-link=tag>glad</a> that&nbsp;I left when I&nbsp;did</strong>.” <a href=#>rainbowdeathcake&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>“It&nbsp;was not worth staying in&nbsp;the toxic relationship. Looking backward, I&nbsp;should have ended it&nbsp;years earlier. The breakup was awful and hurt for a&nbsp;long time but today <strong>my&nbsp;life is&nbsp;far happier</strong>.” <a href=#>LassLeader&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>“I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;3-year-long relationship with a&nbsp;person who did basically all of&nbsp;these things. Reading through that and now being on&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;crazy feeling. It’s an&nbsp;awful way to&nbsp;live. Life is&nbsp;<strong>so&nbsp;much better</strong> on&nbsp;the other side.” <a href=#>hustlerose89&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>“He&nbsp;made me&nbsp;anxious, and&nbsp;I always had a&nbsp;constant knot in&nbsp;my&nbsp;stomach. Would he&nbsp;want me&nbsp;today? Want to&nbsp;break up&nbsp;with me&nbsp;tomorrow? Beg me&nbsp;to&nbsp;stay Wednesday? I&nbsp;never knew. I&nbsp;realized that the relationship was unhealthy for&nbsp;me. It&nbsp;was mentally intoxicating. I&nbsp;finally realized what all my&nbsp;friends/family had realized weeks prior: <strong>I&nbsp;deserve better</strong>. When I&nbsp;realized that being single made me&nbsp;happier than being with him, that was my&nbsp;wake-up call.<br>While leaving a&nbsp;toxic relationship is&nbsp;hard, <strong>your future self will thank you for&nbsp;it</strong>.” <a href=#>daytime_dreamer_&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>“One night&nbsp;I cried myself to&nbsp;sleep because he&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;me&nbsp;and had such cruelty in&nbsp;his eyes, like he&nbsp;was satisfied that&nbsp;I was unhappy. It&nbsp;hurt so&nbsp;much and&nbsp;I realized my&nbsp;partner should be&nbsp;my&nbsp;haven, not a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;stress or&nbsp;resentment. The next day&nbsp;I broke up&nbsp;with him. Now I’m in&nbsp;love with a&nbsp;wonderful man and the way he&nbsp;treats me&nbsp;amazes&nbsp;me, <strong>the difference is&nbsp;night and day</strong>.” <a href=#>chelksea&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Have you or&nbsp;anyone you know experienced any of&nbsp;these feelings? How did you cope with&nbsp;it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIJuvsSaqqimo2LEqcWMqZyoqJyaerTAwLJkoqZdqby5tcJmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpq11tfXN%2Bl29m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-times-lipstick-was-more-than-just-makeup-804647.html><span>←</span><span>10 Times Lipstick Was More Than Just Makeup</span></a>
