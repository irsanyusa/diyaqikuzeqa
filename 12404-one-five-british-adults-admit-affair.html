A quarter have had two affairs, while 20% have had three or more. 8% have had five or more affairs.</p><p>What qualifies as an "affair"? Respondents were also asked specifically what sort of things they have done with people other than their partner. Though 20% admit to an "affair", 22% have romantically kissed someone else, but only 17% have slept with someone else – so perhaps the definition of "affair" lies somewhere in between. And most of the affairs don't appear to have been one-offs: 82% say their longest affair lasted for more than a week, while 7% say less and 6% don't know or don't say. 5% say their longest affair is still ongoing.</p><h2>Men & Women</h2><p>Men are slightly more likely than women to be repeat offenders (49% of cheating men have had more than one affair vs. 41% of women) and more likely to say they have thought about having an affair (37% vs. 29%). However, the number of men and women who have ever had an affair is essentially the same (20% and 19%).</p><p>The survey also investigated who were the most likely partners. 43% have had an affair with someone who qualified as a friend, while 38% have cheated with a work colleague, 18% with a stranger, 12% with an ex and 8% with a neighbour. 3% of affairs involve a partner’s relative.</p><p>This is another area where there are some differences between men and women. Over half of women who have had an affair have cheated with a friend, compared to just a third of men. Men who cheat, on the other hand, are more likely than women to do it with someone who is a work colleague, a stranger or neighbour.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/affairs2.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Men and women also describe slightly different motivations for having their affairs. The main reasons cited by women are "I felt flatterered by the attention" (44%) and "I felt emotionally deprived in my relationship" (43%); among men they are, again, flattery (35%), but also dissatisfaction with their sex life (32%) – something mentioned by only 15% of women.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/affairs3.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2>Methodology</h2><p>Respondents were allowed to opt out of the survey from the start, following a warning that there would be questions of “a personal nature about relationships” along with a reminder that there would be a “Prefer not to say” response option and that all answers are completely anonymous. 89% of respondents chose to participate. Men and women were equally likely to take part.</p><p><strong><a href=#>See the full poll results</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpYml9dXnOp5xmnpmrsm6u0aKroquYYq6lwcutqmaZlKK2tXnAn52aoaI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sport-cutting-horse.html><span>←</span><span>Sport: Cutting Horse | TIME</span></a>
