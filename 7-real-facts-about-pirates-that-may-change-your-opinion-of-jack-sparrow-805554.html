And most likely, he&nbsp;would’ve valued a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;an&nbsp;old map more than a&nbsp;chest full of&nbsp;gold.

Actually, he&nbsp;would’ve most likely been an&nbsp;innkeeper or&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple sailor that would often fall overboard because of&nbsp;his vision problems.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> love pirate movies and learning new things about them. So&nbsp;here’s a&nbsp;new compilation of&nbsp;cool and unexpected facts about pirates. And at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, there’s a&nbsp;bonus about how Julius Caesar acted when he&nbsp;was kidnapped by&nbsp;pirates.</p><p><h2>Jolly Roger could have been red.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a4/5c2/b32df85330b0c338c2362f3cdd.jpg><p>Historians still don’t understand the origin of&nbsp;“Jolly Roger,” which is&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;the pirate flag with the skull and bones image on&nbsp;it. Some people <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believe</a> the term comes from the French “Joli Rouge,” which can be&nbsp;translated as&nbsp;“pretty red.”</p><p>In&nbsp;fact, black and red were the 2&nbsp;most popular colors for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>flags</a>. They would use symbols that reminded opponents of&nbsp;the consequences they would face if&nbsp;they resisted their attacks. Skeletons, skulls, a&nbsp;bloody heart, an&nbsp;hourglass, and wings were the most used symbols on&nbsp;their flags.</p><p><h2>For pirates, maps were more valuable than treasure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb3/c7e/d5978157c88673380dc2decfd3.jpg><p>Of&nbsp;course, pirates loved treasure&nbsp;— who doesn’t? But the most valuable things for them were maps. Many pirates were literate and described their “feats.” For example, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the seventeenth century, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bartholomew Sharpe</a> wrote in&nbsp;his reports that his most valuable treasure was not gold or&nbsp;silver, but rather, an&nbsp;atlas of&nbsp;Spanish sailing charts. Sharpe later commissioned a&nbsp;colorfully illustrated English copy of&nbsp;the stolen atlas and presented it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the king of&nbsp;England.</p><p><h2>Pirates of&nbsp;the Caribbean were named after smoked meat.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d17/dc1/2181db598487497b7880420fe3.jpg><p>Pirates of&nbsp;the Caribbean were named “buccaneers” for their love for meat, smoked or&nbsp;grilled on&nbsp;a&nbsp;wooden frame that the indigenous people of&nbsp;South America and the Caribbean called “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>buccan</a>.” Spaniards would call this process “barbacoa,” a&nbsp;word that later became “barbecue.” So&nbsp;the scary pirates were named after smoked meat.</p><p>In&nbsp;the beginning, landless hunters of&nbsp;wild boars and cattle were named “boucaniers” on&nbsp;the island of&nbsp;Hispaniola. In&nbsp;the largely uninhabited areas of&nbsp;Tortuga and Hispaniola, they smoked the meat they caught and sold it&nbsp;to&nbsp;pirates. Later, people started calling pirates “buccaneers.”</p><p><h2>Life on&nbsp;pirate ships was much more civilized than on&nbsp;merchant ships.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ea/df9/438b91536f9e85b15c939cb99e.jpg><p>The sailors that worked on&nbsp;merchant ships were often caught in&nbsp;very difficult conditions. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;times, there wasn’t enough food on&nbsp;ships, and people were fed with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bad food</a>. More than that, by&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the journey, many were not even paid.</p><p>The life of&nbsp;pirates was more attractive. For example, one of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>codes</a> stated that every crew member had the right to&nbsp;vote on&nbsp;discussed matters. And if&nbsp;someone got seriously injured during a&nbsp;trip, they got very good money as&nbsp;compensation.</p><p><h2>Blackbeard was the scariest pirate in&nbsp;history.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/506/aed/1ec29d5eecb6cdd165ad4be315.jpg><p>Edward Teach, also known as&nbsp;Blackbeard, had a&nbsp;terrible reputation. The hair on&nbsp;his face reached his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>very eyes</a> and was incredibly long. Before fights, he&nbsp;would put fuses into his beard and set them on&nbsp;fire to&nbsp;scare the enemies. But this was mostly for show. There’s no&nbsp;evidence that he&nbsp;ever actually killed someone or&nbsp;harmed his prisoners.</p><p><h2>And his colleague, Stede Bonnet, escaped from his wife to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with pirates.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/785/0c1/947f965bc3a80944227865e489.jpg><p>Stede Bonnet, also known as&nbsp;“The Gentleman Pirate,” didn’t know anything about the sea, but he&nbsp;hired some workers at&nbsp;the shipyard to&nbsp;build him a&nbsp;ship. Then he&nbsp;hired some sailors and became a&nbsp;pirate. Some people <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believe</a> that his wife’s constant nagging pushed Bonnet to&nbsp;such behavior.</p><p><h2>The many Davy Jones theories</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/59c/b6d/33780d5e1aa96b383b367005e4.jpg><p>Researchers have a&nbsp;few versions about who the prototypes of&nbsp;Davy Jones were. According to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the legends, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;pirate that sailed in&nbsp;the Indian ocean in&nbsp;the 1630s. But according to&nbsp;historians, he&nbsp;wasn’t famous enough to&nbsp;be&nbsp;remembered for that long.</p><p>According to&nbsp;another version, Davy Jones was a&nbsp;pub owner that held his clients hostage and sent them to&nbsp;serve on&nbsp;random ships. According to&nbsp;one more version, it&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;short-sighted sailor</a> that would fall overboard very often because of&nbsp;his poor vision.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Julius Caesar made pirates listen to&nbsp;his poems.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae0/d26/b810dd5e5f98abcad4e5f59c30.jpg><p>When Julius Caesar was&nbsp;25, he&nbsp;was kidnapped by&nbsp;pirates. The future emperor felt great. He&nbsp;commanded the pirates and demanded them to&nbsp;let him sleep. More than that, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made</a> pirates listen to&nbsp;his speeches and poems and called them illiterate if&nbsp;they didn’t seem impressed enough.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about pirates?
