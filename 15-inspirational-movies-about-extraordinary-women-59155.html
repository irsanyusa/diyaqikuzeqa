Although women with strong characters are not always liked by&nbsp;others, their personalities attract you like a&nbsp;magnet. More often than not, it’s difficult life circumstances which push them to&nbsp;make decisions that ultimately make them the strong women we&nbsp;all admire.</p><p>The following compilation of&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> which we&nbsp;put together for you includes the stories of&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the strongest and most inspiring women ever to&nbsp;feature on&nbsp;the silver screen.</p><p><h2>Frances&nbsp;Ha (2012)</h2></p><p>Sometimes, we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;do. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not easy to&nbsp;avoid problems in&nbsp;life, even if&nbsp;you are a&nbsp;very easy-going person. The main thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;never give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;your dreams. This story is&nbsp;about the ups and downs of&nbsp;a&nbsp;New York dreamer who was able to&nbsp;make the right decision. She has become an&nbsp;independent woman. She no&nbsp;longer goes with the flow&nbsp;— instead she is&nbsp;in&nbsp;control of&nbsp;her life.</p><p><h2>English Vinglish (2012)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e15/412/feead25c818d8d6e79619f2beb.jpg><p>This film’s heroine is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;rescue the world from the evil or&nbsp;invent the cure for cancer. She is&nbsp;simply a&nbsp;strong woman who is&nbsp;not afraid to&nbsp;improve herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person. Her story is&nbsp;simple and ordinary. The solution to&nbsp;her problems is&nbsp;essentially banal as&nbsp;well&nbsp;— she decides to&nbsp;take some English classes. Nevertheless, the heroine here is&nbsp;strong-willed and able to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;what really matters.</p><p><h2>En&nbsp;kongelig affære (2012)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd5/8b8/c36da65010a05cd7cbc20a87f8.jpg><p>Queens rarely get lucky when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;matters of&nbsp;love. Being happily married becomes a&nbsp;near impossible task, because more often than not, a&nbsp;king prefers the company of&nbsp;others to&nbsp;his own wife. In&nbsp;addition, ruling doesn’t interest them that much. Many of&nbsp;them decide to&nbsp;be&nbsp;patient, try to&nbsp;find good friends, and simply be&nbsp;happy on&nbsp;their own. Unfortunately, life doesn’t always provide&nbsp;us with brave and loving partners, but nevertheless we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;fight to&nbsp;the end.</p><p><h2>Gravity (2013)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d3/e83/69e4655674972fa8b3fb7b875d.jpg><p>Outer <a href=# title=space data-link=tag>space</a>. Loneliness and emptiness. How does one avoid going crazy up&nbsp;there, especially if&nbsp;you’re stranded outside of&nbsp;any spaceship, beyond safety, with nothing but the vast, utterly empty universe around you? This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;incredible story of&nbsp;the willpower, stamina, and courage of&nbsp;one woman who ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;incredibly dangerous situation. A&nbsp;characteristically brilliant performance from <a href=# title="Sandra Bullock" data-link=tag>Sandra Bullock</a> keeps the audience on&nbsp;the edge of&nbsp;their seats throughout the whole film. As&nbsp;viewers we&nbsp;cannot help but empathise and imagine ourselves in&nbsp;her shoes. Not every man would be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;overcome every obstacle this heroine faced.</p><p><h2 class=adme-img-copyright>Clouds of&nbsp;Sils Maria (2014)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/60c/f02/721af051909471169bd87094fc.jpeg><p>An&nbsp;ageing movie star, Maria Enders, receives an&nbsp;offer to&nbsp;play a&nbsp;successful, but naive and not very young businesswoman that has fallen in&nbsp;love with her young secretary. It&nbsp;seems like ordinary work for an&nbsp;actor, but the truth is&nbsp;that Maria already played the exact same role in&nbsp;the exact same play when she began her career 20&nbsp;years earlier. This new role really lets Maria down. How can she move from one role to&nbsp;another and accept the new her?</p><p><h2 class=adme-img-copyright>Still Alice (2014)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/JPG/ff9/8b6/3d5c9d5952a4cf6774cd659c28.JPG><p>A&nbsp;professor of&nbsp;linguistics wakes up&nbsp;one day and realises that she is&nbsp;forgetting words. She begins to&nbsp;forget the names of&nbsp;her family and friends&nbsp;— all due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;rapidly advancing case of&nbsp;Alzheimer’s disease. But Alice still remembers that she is&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy person. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;wonderful film that you have to&nbsp;watch in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;remind yourself that every moment of&nbsp;your life is&nbsp;precious.</p><p><h2 class=adme-img-copyright>Ма&nbsp;Ма (2015)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8bc/3f0/e55868521e8eb2f437626bddfd.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you recognise her? Yes, this is&nbsp;Penélope Cruz. Here the actress plays a&nbsp;talented teacher and a&nbsp;loving mother, Magda. She has to&nbsp;summon the strength to&nbsp;keep her life together in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;overcome a&nbsp;serious illness and take back her right to&nbsp;live and be&nbsp;happy.</p><p><h2>Gone Girl (2015)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/236/fb1/8e5ce35bebb9b02e25575502dd.jpg><p>She’s crazy, but at&nbsp;the same time she’s very loving. Where is&nbsp;the border between passion and madness? Right before her fifth wedding anniversary, she disappears leaving a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;clues and riddles to&nbsp;her husband. This smart and creative woman often organised surprises like this for her husband. What awaits him this time?</p><p><h2>The Age of&nbsp;Adaline (2015)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/698/11c/a8bb49515f92b6c796cb3f0986.jpg><p>How does it&nbsp;feel to&nbsp;live longer than your loved ones? How does it&nbsp;feel to&nbsp;never get old, to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;constantly keep your distance from people and always move from place to&nbsp;place, so&nbsp;nobody ever learns your secret? How does it&nbsp;feel to&nbsp;see your only daughter grow old and know that she will leave this world before you? The Age of&nbsp;Adeline is&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful, fiercely honest, and genuinely <a href=# title=romantic data-link=tag>romantic</a> film.</p><p><h2>Woman in&nbsp;Gold (2015)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d94/5f0/61cc6f5c31a904a3ece35e61c7.jpg><p>The main character of&nbsp;this movie, played by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Helen Mirren" data-link=tag>Helen Mirren</a>, has been through a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;pain. Now she is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;fight for justice by&nbsp;bringing back her family’s treasure, a&nbsp;painting by&nbsp;Gustav Klimt. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;one woman’s struggle with an&nbsp;entire state. This films tells&nbsp;us about values, and the past that should be&nbsp;remembered and respected.</p><p><h2>Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/434/106/4884965cc1b7fc780670350f08.jpg><p>Although this movie is&nbsp;named after a&nbsp;man, Max, the main character is&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman. This woman lives in&nbsp;a&nbsp;post-apocalyptic world. She once attained outstanding individual success, and almost started a&nbsp;revolution. The marvellous <a href=# title="Charlize Theron" data-link=tag>Charlize Theron</a> masterfully portrays a&nbsp;furious woman who is&nbsp;searching for her own personal paradise, and tries to&nbsp;save other women from a&nbsp;fanatic society.</p><p><h2>Suffragette (2015)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/205/8f9/9d88525293b7d921e6987fe226.jpg><p>Suffragettes are not simply ’extremists’ who throw stones at&nbsp;shop windows. These are ordinary women, loving wives, mothers and daughters. Their main concern is&nbsp;gender equality. They face issues of&nbsp;sexual harassment at&nbsp;the workplace, domestic violence and violation of&nbsp;their parental rights. Their salaries are much smaller than that of&nbsp;their male colleagues. And for the first time, their experiences are brought to&nbsp;the screen in&nbsp;this fantastic film.</p><p><h2 class=adme-img-copyright>Sicario (2015)</h2></p><p>A&nbsp;female police officer, without any concern for herself, accompanies two rangers in&nbsp;their hunt for drug dealers. She has no&nbsp;inkling of&nbsp;the danger she’s getting herself in&nbsp;to, but that wouldn’t stop her even if&nbsp;she knew&nbsp;— for she is&nbsp;unbending in&nbsp;her desire to&nbsp;aid the struggle for justice. Soon, a&nbsp;choice stands before her: reveal the dark secrets she has uncovered and risk being killed, or&nbsp;live with the terrible situation she finds herself&nbsp;in.</p><p><h2 class=adme-img-copyright>Joy (2015)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/d00/293/f4fb45571790f73998ee565cc2.jpeg><p>Although you will have to&nbsp;wait a&nbsp;little before you can see this film, we&nbsp;just couldn’t leave it&nbsp;out of&nbsp;our list considering the past performance of&nbsp;the actresses involved. The plot of&nbsp;this film is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;Joy Mangano, a&nbsp;single mother from Long Island, who invented a&nbsp;miracle-broom when she became disappointed with regular cleaning goods. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, she became one of&nbsp;the most successful entrepreneurs in&nbsp;the world.</p><p><h2 class=adme-img-copyright>The Dressmaker (2015)</h2></p><p>A&nbsp;glamorous woman comes back to&nbsp;the hometown that she left because of&nbsp;the murder charges made against her when she was still a&nbsp;child. Her hometown’s citizens do&nbsp;not welcome her, but she slowly wins over the local women due to&nbsp;her wit and sewing skills. An&nbsp;intriguing story starring the unbeatable Kate Winslet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52ecinqqmhopbBqrvNmqNmpZ%2Brtqa%2FjJqZqK2kYrK5wNGapqucmaOus8WMsKamnZ5ignp9lG5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./12404-one-five-british-adults-admit-affair.html><span>←</span><span>1 in 5 British adults say they've had an affair</span></a>
