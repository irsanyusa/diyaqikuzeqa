On Instagram, the former Bachelorette alum subtly shaded the show for not including her in their previous t-shirt design.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gabby-windey-shades-dancing-with-the-stars-on-her-instagram-story>Gabby Windey Shades Dancing With The Stars on Her Instagram Story</h2><p>On October 17, Windey uploaded a mirror selfie of herself wearing a T-shirt from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS tour</a>. The shirt featured pro and troupe dancers from the competition show. In front of the photo, Windey added context, written very small.</p><p>“Me co hosting this tour and sleeping in a bus with triple decker bunk beds and no where to found on this shirt lolz,” she wrote.</p><p>From her statement, many probably think that she’s disappointed that she wasn’t included in the design. For those wondering, the shirt featured Britt Stewart, Alan Bersten, Emma Slater, Gleb Savchenko, Brandon Armstrong, Sasha Farber, Alexis Warr, and Kateryna Klishyna.</p><p>Last year, Windey was one of the main <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrities</a> on the tour, co-hosting alongside Slater. The duo took on this role from January 6 in National Harbor, Maryland until March 12 in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>Anyone who knows Windey, knows that she’s quite the jokester on social media. She’s often making jokes like this one on her Instagram, so this comment should be laughed at. It’s clear she had no ill intent with this statement, since she attended DWTS‘s Disney100 Night on the same day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-recently-opened-up-about-girlfriend-robby-hoffman>She Recently Opened Up About Girlfriend Robby Hoffman</h2><p>In August, Windey <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">came out</a> as queer and announced that she’s dating gay comedian Robby Hoffman. Since then, she became open with her romantic relationship on her social media accounts. Most recently, Windey detailed her shopping trips with Hoffman.</p><p>“She got this really amazing pair of pants the other day … I was like, ‘Oh my God, I love,’ and she’s like, ‘Thanks for being so supportive.’ We know what each other likes and what’s worth the purchase,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>As her and Hoffman’s love for each other continues to grow, her interest in fashion also proceeds to elevate. The DWTS alum has recently collaborated with fashion brand Cupshe and released a holiday collection with the company.</p><p>“Like our personalities or who we are, [style] just continues to evolve and grow with us,” she says, adding, “I’m kind of having this reinvigoration for fashion and it’s been so much fun.”</p><p>At present, Windey is preparing to spend her first holiday with the comedian. According to the television personality, they are “planning to hibernate in the cabin and watch the snowfall” in Hoffman’s country home in Lake Arrowhead. As for her holiday gift for her girlfriend, she said that she’s trying to “get creative.” Nonetheless, gift-giving has been on top of their love languages at the moment.</p><p>“We try and get each other flowers a lot,” she said. “She got me a three-legged pig, which is supposed to be good luck, pretty early on … We try and spoil each other as much as we can.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_RoyalHen_Michael-Becker-_-FOX-220x147.jpg alt="Who is the Royal Hen? ‘The Masked Singer’ Prediction & Clues!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Gabby Windey</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xpqZm7FdrLavsMSyZKytkqm5unnSoZidnaNisaK6wqKloGWnnsGpedOhnGarpJa%2FtHnOp2ShnaJitq%2B%2F05qeq5mdYsC1u9GyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./green-irish-st-patricks-day-color.html><span>←</span><span>Why We Wear Green on St. Patricks Day</span></a>
