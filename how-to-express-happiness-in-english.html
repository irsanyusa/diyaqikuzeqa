While the subject and the “be” verb can vary, the adjective will always stay the same.&nbsp;</p><p>The following adjectives all convey feelings of happiness with&nbsp;slight&nbsp;differences.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Chuffed&nbsp;(U.K. – informal)</strong> – Very pleased</li></ul><p>“Her aunt sent her a lovely birthday gift – she’s chuffed!”&nbsp;(present simple)</p><ul><li><strong>Ecstatic&nbsp;</strong>– Very happy or excited</li></ul><p>“She was ecstatic when she learned she was pregnant.”&nbsp;(past simple)</p><ul><li><strong>Stoked&nbsp;(U.S. – informal)</strong> – Extremely excited&nbsp;</li></ul><p>“Everyone is stoked about the camping trip next weekend!”&nbsp;(present simple)</p><ul><li><strong>Overjoyed&nbsp;</strong>– Filled with happiness</li></ul><p>“If they offer me the promotion at work, I will be overjoyed!”&nbsp;(future simple)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>English idioms to express happiness</h2><p>As you may know, an idiom is a group of words that, together, create a new meaning that’s different from the meaning of each separate word.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although they sometimes seem like nonsense, these phrases can be a fantastic way to express your feelings specifically and accurately.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Idioms beginning with a preposition</h3><p>Idioms that begin with prepositions – like&nbsp;on,&nbsp;over, or&nbsp;in, – can be used in basically the same way as the adjectives described above. While the subject and the tense of the “be” verb can change, the idiom itself will stay the same.&nbsp;</p><p>Their structure looks like this: subject + be + idiom</p><p>The following idioms all have more or less the same meaning, as well; they express a feeling of&nbsp;<strong>extreme&nbsp;</strong>happiness.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>On cloud nine&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>“We have a brand new apartment downtown – I’m on cloud nine!”&nbsp;(present simple)</p><ul><li><strong>Over the moon</strong></li></ul><p>“When my friend found out she was getting her dream job, she was over the moon!”&nbsp;(past simple)</p><ul><li><strong>On top of the world</strong></li></ul><p>“Whenever I finish a good workout, I’m on top of the world.”&nbsp;(present simple)</p><ul><li><strong>In seventh heaven</strong></li></ul><p>“Try some of the cake my mom made: You’ll be in seventh heaven!”&nbsp;(future simple)</p><p>What did you notice about the above <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">idioms</a>? Well, they’re all about being very high up! The idea of happiness is often connected with rising high above the world.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Idioms beginning with a verb</h3><p>This next <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">set of idioms</a> is a little different: They contain verbs, so their structure can change depending on the subject and the time of the action.</p><ul><li><strong>Grin from ear to ear</strong> – To smile widely&nbsp;</li></ul><p>“You look like you have some good news – you’re grinning from ear to ear!”&nbsp;(present continuous)</p><ul><li><strong>Jump for joy</strong> – To be very happy or excited about something&nbsp;</li></ul><p>“When I finally see my boyfriend after two months apart, I’ll jump for joy!”&nbsp;(future simple)</p><ul><li><strong>Have the time of (one’s) life</strong> – To have an extremely fun or exciting time</li></ul><p>“I wish you’d come on vacation with us! We had the time of our lives!”&nbsp;(past simple)</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>English expressions to show happiness for others</h3><p>When someone shares good news with you, it’s important to respond correctly. If you don’t have the right words, it might seem like you’re not happy or excited – you might even appear a bit rude.</p><p>Well, don’t worry! Here are some expressions to help you show happiness or excitement for others!</p><p>“Wow! You got a perfect score on your maths exam!”</p><p>“You were selected to make a speech at your graduation ceremony? That’s amazing!”</p><p>“It’s great that you’re finally getting a new car. You deserve it!”</p><p>“You’re moving? Fantastic! I can’t wait to see your new house!”</p><ul><li><strong>I’m so excited for you</strong></li></ul><p>“I heard you’re quitting your job to become a singer. I’m so excited for you!”</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Better than happy</strong></h4><p>Next time you’re feeling good, think beyond “happy.” Try some of the expressions above to add more meaning to your conversations!</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Andrea-1.jpg><h2>Andrea Byaruhanga</h2><p>Andrea is a Canadian freelance writer and editor specializing in English, e-learning, EdTech, and SaaS.
