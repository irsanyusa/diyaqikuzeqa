Humorously, she also noted that her mother did not want her to win the cash prize in fear of the cash prize leading her astray.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-5b721137-a5eb-41b0-acf5-a9dadc3d5637 data-caption="Beverly Osu was never selected for eviction during her time in Big Brother Africa [Instagram/Beverly Osu]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/nP0ktkpTURBXy9jNzBkMWMxNThiMDE5NmQ2N2QwMDNkNzQ1NzVkNjgxMy5qcGeSlQPMSgDNA5DNBPuVAs0DFs0EUcLD></span> <span class=caption>Beverly Osu was never selected for eviction during her time in Big Brother Africa [Instagram/Beverly Osu]</span> <span class=copyright>Pulse Nigeria</span><p>She said, "I'm happy I didn't win now because there was nothing I was going to do then that was going to make me win. If the fans were praying for me to win, the woman who birthed me was praying to God that 'If this child is going to win this money and go astray, because she has gone astray before,. If she is going to win this money and go astray, God please don't give it to her.'"</p><p><a href=# id=3ecfca90-f0b9-4a91-9394-bb4347d930e5 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>The actress</a> remarked on how her life and career have evolved positively since then, acknowledging that she might not have had the maturity to manage the prize money effectively at that time.</p><p>"God's timing is the best and we are happy that now we have made more than that money. If I had the money then, I probably would not have known what to do with it then. I didn't have the experience to make it impactful in my life so yeah, so far I'm winning in life now," she explained.</p><p>See the full interview below:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGaipV2drrG82GagZpyZmbu1edaipWaamZx6o77OrZ%2Beql2Ws7O1wppkrJ2RqLyveZdmmZ6ulae5unnOrKxopp2gs3qD1Q%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-laila-ali-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Laila Ali Make?
