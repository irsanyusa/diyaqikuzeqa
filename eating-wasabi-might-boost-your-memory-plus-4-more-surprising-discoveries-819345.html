Half of&nbsp;them took 100 milligrams of&nbsp;wasabi extract every night before bed, while the other half got a&nbsp;fake treatment.</p><p>Lead researcher Rui Nouchi explained that while earlier animal studies hinted at&nbsp;wasabi’s health perks, they were stunned by&nbsp;the significant improvement in&nbsp;participants’ <a href=# title=memory data-link=tag>memory</a>. After just three months, those who took the wasabi extract saw their episodic memory scores shoot up&nbsp;by&nbsp;an&nbsp;average of&nbsp;18%, and they scored&nbsp;14% higher than the placebo group in&nbsp;tests measuring language skills and concentration.</p><p>The study highlighted that the main active compound in&nbsp;wasabi, 6-MSITC, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This compound is&nbsp;rare in&nbsp;the plant world and is&nbsp;responsible for much of&nbsp;wasabi’s health benefits.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>True wasabi</a>, native to&nbsp;Japan, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;finicky plant that takes two years to&nbsp;grow and is&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;cultivate. Unfortunately, 99% of&nbsp;wasabi found in&nbsp;the United States is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fake</a>. Real wasabi has a&nbsp;more nuanced and sweeter taste compared to&nbsp;the imitations commonly found.</p><p>The good news&nbsp;is, even a&nbsp;small amount of&nbsp;real wasabi can offer the same benefits as&nbsp;the concentrated capsules used in&nbsp;the study. So, if&nbsp;you can get your hands on&nbsp;real wasabi, a&nbsp;little dab might do&nbsp;wonders for your memory.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;study suggests that pregnancy could rewire change the brain.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a5/153/1834b1542192b1a058253f3525.jpg><p>A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> by&nbsp;London’s Francis Crick Institute, published in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Science</strong></a>, indicates that <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> initiates enduring changes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother’s <a href=# title=brain data-link=tag>brain</a>. These alterations, observed in&nbsp;the hypothalamus, prioritize nurturing behaviors over mating instincts, as&nbsp;evidenced by&nbsp;mother mice exhibiting caregiving tendencies towards their offspring while virgin mice show no&nbsp;interest.</p><p>These findings parallel similar adjustments observed in&nbsp;human mothers, persisting for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;two years postpartum, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>enhancing</a> abilities like multitasking and <a href=# title=empathy data-link=tag>empathy</a>. Understanding these neurological changes is&nbsp;pivotal for addressing postpartum depression, potentially stemming from hormonal fluctuations post-birth.</p><p>Comprehending how pregnancy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>impacts the brain</a> is&nbsp;essential for maternal well-being. The rapid decline in&nbsp;estrogen and progesterone levels post-birth, as&nbsp;noted by&nbsp;the Office on&nbsp;Women’s Health, may contribute to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>postpartum depression</a>, underscoring the importance of&nbsp;further research into hormonal therapies. Prof. Robert Froemke of&nbsp;NYU Langone emphasizes the complexity of&nbsp;parenting behaviors and the necessity of&nbsp;understanding brain changes for effective postnatal care.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;new study has figured out how whales sing underwater.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/cb5/37b/60bbe750a18d9dcde0c482ace6.jpeg><p>A&nbsp;groundbreaking study in&nbsp;the journal <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Nature</strong></a> has finally unveiled how baleen whales, like humpbacks, create their mesmerizing songs underwater. It&nbsp;turns out they have a&nbsp;unique voice box, or&nbsp;larynx, evolved specifically for sound production.</p><p>Unlike other mammals, their larynx has a&nbsp;long, rigid shape that facilitates large air flows during breathing and feeding. Additionally, they have evolved nasal and oral plugs to&nbsp;protect their airways from water, along with air sacs to&nbsp;recycle air while producing vocal sounds.</p><p>To&nbsp;conduct the study, led by&nbsp;Professor Coen Elemans from the University of&nbsp;Southern Denmark, researchers examined the larynxes of&nbsp;minke, humpback, and sei whales in&nbsp;the lab. Using computer models, they simulated aspects that couldn’t be&nbsp;measured directly.</p><p>What they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discovered</a> was a&nbsp;completely novel mechanism unique to&nbsp;baleen whales, which evolved around 40&nbsp;million years ago, enabling successful <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> underwater. However, human-made ocean noise poses a&nbsp;significant threat to&nbsp;these majestic creatures, disrupting their ability to&nbsp;communicate and mate. Elemans <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hopes</a> this study will encourage efforts to&nbsp;reduce human noise pollution in&nbsp;oceans, allowing whales to&nbsp;thrive.</p><p><h2>Bacteria on&nbsp;pillowcases might be&nbsp;more than on&nbsp;toilet seats.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/d53/f0e/6a5ae75da0be3b791c344fbf18.jpeg><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent report by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Amerisleep</strong></a>, your bedding could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;breeding ground for <a href=# title=bacteria data-link=tag>bacteria</a>, even after a&nbsp;thorough wash. Pillowcases, for instance, might contain up&nbsp;to&nbsp;17&nbsp;thousand times more bacteria than your average toilet seat, while sheets can accumulate nearly 25&nbsp;thousand times more bacteria than a&nbsp;bathroom doorknob within just one week.</p><p>This bacterium isn’t just benign; it&nbsp;includes strains that can cause infections like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pneumonia</a> and contribute to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>antibiotic resistance</a>. Even bacteria typically associated with food poisoning have been found on&nbsp;bedding surfaces.</p><p>To&nbsp;maintain cleaner bedding, experts recommend increasing the frequency of&nbsp;washing pillowcases, especially if&nbsp;you sweat heavily, have oily skin or&nbsp;hair, or&nbsp;regularly go&nbsp;to&nbsp;bed with makeup&nbsp;on. Washing once a&nbsp;week might not suffice, as&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>accumulated</a> wear and tear on&nbsp;your pillowcase can harbor significant bacteria, even without obvious signs. Different types of&nbsp;fabric, such as&nbsp;satin or&nbsp;cotton, don’t necessarily affect bacteria growth, so&nbsp;proper cleaning methods are essential regardless of&nbsp;material.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/711/c7f/d897525c16947d7da126095b02.jpg><p>When laundering pillowcases, it’s crucial to&nbsp;use hot water, a&nbsp;heavy-duty cycle, a&nbsp;detergent with enzymes, and suitable bleach to&nbsp;ensure thorough cleaning. However, bacteria aren’t the only concern; pillows also absorb sweat, oils, and dead skin cells, potentially leading to&nbsp;mold, mildew, and allergen buildup.</p><p>To&nbsp;mitigate this, Amerisleep recommends replacing pillows every 1–2&nbsp;years. By&nbsp;incorporating regular laundering and periodic pillow replacement into your routine, you can maintain a&nbsp;cleaner and healthier sleep environment, making your bed a&nbsp;more inviting place than your bathroom.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;new study suggests that African elephants have a&nbsp;unique way of&nbsp;identifying themselves, akin to&nbsp;how humans use names.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/427/9bf/9ce7db544f8d7095fa64ee1f53.jpeg><p>A&nbsp;study, published in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Nature Ecology &&nbsp;Evolution</strong></a>, suggests that African elephants possess a&nbsp;remarkable ability to&nbsp;distinguish themselves from others using unique sounds, akin to&nbsp;how humans use names. Through extensive <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>observation</a> in&nbsp;Kenya’s Samburu National Reserve and Amboseli National Park, researchers found that elephants emit individually specific calls, allowing them to&nbsp;address one another over long distances across the savanna.</p><p>Using machine learning techniques, scientists demonstrated that elephants can predict the recipient of&nbsp;a&nbsp;call <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>based</a> solely on&nbsp;its acoustic structure, indicating a&nbsp;sophisticated form of&nbsp;communication that goes beyond mere imitation. This discovery challenges previous assumptions about how elephants communicate and highlights their cognitive complexity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/92a/aeb/613c6b5f519cd5e7695797780c.jpeg><p>When researchers played recordings of&nbsp;elephant “names,” the elephants reacted excitedly. They flapped their ears and lifted their trunks, showing that they recognized their own sounds. It’s kind of&nbsp;like how we&nbsp;perk up&nbsp;when someone says our name.</p><p>This ability to&nbsp;use names helps elephants stick together in&nbsp;their groups. Just like how we&nbsp;might call out to&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend in&nbsp;a&nbsp;crowded place, elephants use names to&nbsp;find each other, especially after getting separated. This study helps&nbsp;us understand how smart and social <a href=#><strong>elephants really are</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLKiwMinnmavkaiuo7WMpqCgoKRir7C70q1ksqelp3quscyoqbJloKHCtHmTZqSoqpViwLa%2Bz6ugrKGenHqltdKcpq%2Bdop6ytHmXanBsbGVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-necessary-skills-to-teach-your-child-before-they-turn-13-802685.html><span>←</span><span>10 Necessary Skills To Teach Your Child Before They Turn 13</span></a>
