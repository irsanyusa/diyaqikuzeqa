Located in the heart of Europe, the country boasts not only rich history, beautiful architecture and low cost of living, but also a long tradition of high-quality education. Follow our step-by-step guide to find everything you need to know about applying to a Czech university!</p><h2>How can I apply to study in Czech Republic?</h2><h3><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose a study programme in the Czech Republic<br></strong></h3><p>Although most courses and programmes offered at Czech universities are taught in the Czech language, there are hundreds of options for foreign speaking students across all fields and degree levels, too.</p><p>Browse our <strong><a href=#>Czech University Search</a></strong> to discover which universities offer the programme you are interested in. If you’re not sure what major to study, you can take our <a href=#><strong>Test „What to study“</strong></a> and find out which programmes should fit you.</p><p>Study programmes conducted in the Czech language at public universities are free of charge, but studies in foreign languages are subject to tuition fees. However, the tuition fees in the Czech Republic are usually much lower than elsewhere in Western Europe and the United States. There are also multiple <a href=#>scholarship options</a> for international students coming to study in the Czech Republic.</p><h3><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at deadlines</strong></h3><p>The application deadline at Czech universities is usually between February and April, but requirements might differ at different schools, so you should always double check the specific deadlines and requirements for admission.</p><h3><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare necessary documents</strong></h3><p>The basic condition for beginning a university degree is a successful completion of the previous level of study. You will need to prepare the certificate of graduation from a secondary school to start studying a Bachelor’s degree (3 years) and long-cycle Master’s degree programmes (5-6 years); Bachelor’s degree for a follow-up Master’s; Master’s degree for a Doctoral study programme).</p><p>Czech universities generally require students to have their previous studies recognized by the Czech authority. The process of <strong>recognition of previous studies</strong> is called „nostrifikace“.</p><p>More information about the recognition of previous studies is also available at the Czech Ministry of Education.</p><h3><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare specific entry requirements</strong></h3><p>Each university is responsible for its own admission process and has various conditions upon which admission is granted. Besides certified copies of your previous education, the minimum entry requirements usually include a completed and submitted application form and a payment of application fee (approximately between USD 30-50).</p><p>Each university and department might also require applicants to send extra documents such as letter of motivation, CV, letter of recommendation, English proficiency test scores, portfolio, etc.)</p><h3><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submit your application</strong></h3><p>Most universities use electronic application forms, which guide students step-by-step through the admission process and let them track the status of their application. However, most universities require students to send a hard copy of the application form alongside with other documents by post.</p><p>You should therefore always <strong>check the specific requirements on the university websites </strong>and if you need some advice, you can contact the study department or the international office of the relevant university</p><h3><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass the entrance exam</strong></h3><p>Applicants to Czech universities might be invited to sit an entrance exam (if one is required). Entrance examinations are normally held within the period of May to June or July, unless the faculty determines otherwise. Entrance exams are usually held in the university campus, but some programmes might allow taking the exam from abroad, for example by conducting the interview through Skype.</p><p>Entrance exams for English-taught study programmes should be proceeded in English. Foreign students who did not attend high school in the Czech Republic and are applying for a study programme taught in Czech may be required to take an additional test to demonstrate their Czech language ability.</p><h3><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receive your results</strong></h3><p>Results are usually announced by the end of June. After receiving the decision, the university might ask you to pay the relevant tuition fee for the first semester, if applicable. Then, you shall receive an official letter of admission and admission confirmation for the visa and accommodation purposes which will allow you to proceed to the last step!</p><h3><strong>&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply for visa</strong></h3><p>Depending on your nationality and status, you might have to apply for a visa or residence permit to enter the Czech Republic. You should start your visa application as soon as you receive the official letter of admission, as the procedure can take up to 60 days if you are from non-EU countries.
