She pushes back against her advisors’ proposals and puts the safety of her children first. In Episode 3, we see Rhaenyra sit down with her step-daughter <a href=#>Rhaena Targaryen</a> (Phoebe Campbell) and task her with taking Rhaenyra’s three children to safety in Pentos. At first, Rhaena feels that the task at hand is not as important as going into battle with her sister and the others, until she is told she’d also be traveling with four dragon eggs, which are “the hope for the future.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Why New Targaryens Keep Popping up on House of the Dragon</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The chest <a href=#>containing the dragon eggs</a> is opened and we see three eggs that Game of Thrones fans might recognize: a green one, a black one, and a gold one. The <a href=#>director of Episode 3</a>, Geeta Vasant Patel, spoke to Mashable and confirmed that the eggs featured in last night’s episode are indeed the ones gifted to Daenerys in the <a href=#>pilot episode of Game of Thrones</a> by Master Illyrio Mopatis (Roger Allam) after she marries Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa). “All of us who work on this show are big Game of Thrones fans, so it was very exciting to shoot that scene,” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>House of the Dragon Keeps Pushing the Song of Ice and Fire Prophecy—and It’s Not Working</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The events that take place in House of the Dragon are different from the book it’s based on. In George R.R. Martin’s Fire & Blood, the eggs were stolen by a noblewoman named Elissa Farman during the reign of Jaehaerys I. Elissa, the lover of Princess <a href=#>Rhaena Targaryen</a> (not to be confused with Rhaena from House of the Dragon, different generations), sailed to Braavos where she sold the eggs to pay for voyages. Per Mashable, the eggs’ journey to Illyrio Mopatis isn’t detailed in depth, but it’s theorized they were continuously sold until they made their way to him.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now that Patel has confirmed this major plot point, viewers can begin to theorize about what happens to the fourth egg. One leading theory that has emerged: that it becomes Rhaena’s dragon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWlpgHSAjqGmrquVYrynedOhnGacopa0sLrSZpypoaOksaZ5kmabq5mXpLtuscagqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wilt-1200427724.html><span>←</span><span>Wilt</span></a>
