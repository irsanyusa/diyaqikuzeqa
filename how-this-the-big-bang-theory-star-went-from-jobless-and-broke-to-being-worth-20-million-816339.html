Despite promising auditions and small roles in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few movies, her breakthrough role remained elusive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a9/2b8/b89dd15ec98d3312ce95bee69f.jpg><p>Rauch <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attempted</a> to&nbsp;get into a&nbsp;theater career, but quickly realized that it&nbsp;wasn’t exactly the L.A. crowd’s scene: “Not a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people showed up&nbsp;because not a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people see theater in&nbsp;L.A.” Overall, these initial years were marked by&nbsp;disappointments, casting in&nbsp;comedies that never saw the light of&nbsp;day, and even a&nbsp;failed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attempt</a> to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;hand model.</p><p><h2>Landing the role of&nbsp;Bernadette saved her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/031/d7e/d8958e50848dc9acb8d317f10b.jpg><p>Rauch’s journey reached a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>critical</a> point when she began to&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;unemployment checks to&nbsp;make ends meet. Her financial struggles had become so&nbsp;profound that she found herself navigating the bureaucracy of&nbsp;the unemployment office. The week Melissa found out she got cast in&nbsp;<i>The Big Bang Theory</i> was very dark for her. At&nbsp;the time, she even attended a&nbsp;seminar teaching her how to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b0/ccc/ba1c8f5210b7342a13d6fc95c1.jpg><p>Receiving the news that she got the part was extremely needed for her at&nbsp;the time. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a> the moment she could share her triumph with her partner: “I&nbsp;stepped over the homeless man sleeping outside my&nbsp;building, opened the door and screamed to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband that&nbsp;I got the part.”</p><p><h2>Her rise to&nbsp;success came fast.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb2/f8c/e262ac54adaf9b1bb16ac98ca0.jpg><p>James Atoa/Everett Collection/East News</p><p>Even though Melissa were only cast for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>one</a> episode at&nbsp;the time, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;dream come true for her. As&nbsp;we&nbsp;now know, she made enough of&nbsp;a&nbsp;good impression to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;recurring guest star when Howard and Bernadette finally became a&nbsp;real couple. By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the season 5&nbsp;of&nbsp;the show, the characters were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a>, and Bernadette became a&nbsp;permanent cast member.</p><p>Being an&nbsp;official part of&nbsp;<i>The Big Bang Theory</i> family meant that Rauch was included in&nbsp;award shows. In&nbsp;total, the actress was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award four times as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the hit series’ ensemble. Aside from professional recognition, Melissa could also boast a&nbsp;sizeable <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>salary</a> that grew from $75,000 per episode to&nbsp;a&nbsp;whopping $500,000 by&nbsp;the show’s final season.</p><p><h2>Life after <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/185/890/15cc5b52808b9bffa9ee8f937f.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most successful sitcoms wrapped up&nbsp;in&nbsp;2019. It&nbsp;changed Melissa’s life forever and set her net <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worth</a> at&nbsp;$20&nbsp;million. While still working on&nbsp;the show, she’d taken up&nbsp;other <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>projects</a>, most notably voice work for <i>Ice Age: Collision Course </i>and <i>Batman and Harley Quinn</i>. In&nbsp;2020 Rauch gave <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>birth</a> to&nbsp;her second child and, seemingly, decided to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break from acting. Today, she’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>returned</a> with a&nbsp;bang as&nbsp;a&nbsp;lead in&nbsp;the revival of&nbsp;a&nbsp;popular 80s series <i>Night Court.</i></p><p>Melissa’s inspiring journey and a&nbsp;stellar performance in&nbsp;<i>The Big Bang Theory</i> reminded&nbsp;us how much we&nbsp;loved the show.
