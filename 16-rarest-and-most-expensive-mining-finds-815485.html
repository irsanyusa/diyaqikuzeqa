Ready for a&nbsp;treasure hunt? Hmm, or&nbsp;maybe we&nbsp;can just take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;what other people found? Without leaving our comfort zone, you know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4f9/43f/43bf71539d8079e0c662a705dd.png><p>Tanzanite is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stone that’s more valuable and expensive than diamonds. This gem was first discovered in&nbsp;1967 in&nbsp;— the name probably gives it&nbsp;away&nbsp;— Tanzania. Tanzanite became popular after Tiffany and&nbsp;Co. began to&nbsp;use it&nbsp;in&nbsp;their jewelry.</p><p>The stone costs $200-350 per carat. This number isn’t that high compared to&nbsp;other gems on&nbsp;my&nbsp;list, but experts say that the stone’s price will rocket up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the next 20–25&nbsp;years. Its deep blue-violet hue differs the gem from others. Plus, it&nbsp;can only be&nbsp;mined in&nbsp;one place on&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>The next gemstone is&nbsp;red beryl. Although they are not as&nbsp;rare as&nbsp;some others, like black opal, it’s hard to&nbsp;find gem-quality ones. And you can only come across red beryl on&nbsp;a&nbsp;mountain in&nbsp;Utah. Yet, with its few different shades of&nbsp;a&nbsp;darker red, this gemstone is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the rarest in&nbsp;the whole beryl family. Prices for this red beauty can reach up&nbsp;to&nbsp;$10,000 per carat&nbsp;— but good luck finding it&nbsp;on&nbsp;sale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b7d/e05/c116e7512c9bcf51c845f0e623.png><p>With their mesmerizing green hues, emeralds are quite popular. Most emeralds have minor imperfections. Like me. On&nbsp;rare occasions, a&nbsp;natural emerald without any flaws appears on&nbsp;the market. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;sold for jaw-dropping money.</p><p>For instance, when the historic “Rockefeller Emerald” was auctioned off, the 18-carat gemstone was purchased for $5.5 million&nbsp;— which is&nbsp;$305,000 per carat. This way, it&nbsp;broke all records, being the highest price-per-carat emerald ever sold.</p><p>Opal is&nbsp;a&nbsp;valuable multicolored stone found mostly in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a>. The most common types are white, gray, and green opals. But here, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;the rarest one: black opal. Black opal has many colors in&nbsp;it, like a&nbsp;<a href=# title=rainbow data-link=tag>rainbow</a>. And each time you look at&nbsp;it, you may see some other colors that you haven’t noticed before.</p><p>It’s really hard to&nbsp;mine this one. There’s no&nbsp;guarantee at&nbsp;all that you’ll find&nbsp;it. This “Virgin Rainbow” opal is&nbsp;valued at&nbsp;$1&nbsp;million and has become the world’s most expensive opal. It&nbsp;was discovered in&nbsp;2003 by&nbsp;John Dunstan. What’s even cooler is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;was found inside an&nbsp;ancient cuttlefish skeleton. Who would think of&nbsp;looking there?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5eb/a99/0c8d2f5f929b3448b467d7d014.png><p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;ring with the Sunrise ruby. Its name comes from a&nbsp;poem with the same title written in&nbsp;the 13th century. What makes this stone famous is&nbsp;not its name, though. It&nbsp;was sold in&nbsp;2015 for $30&nbsp;million, which made it&nbsp;the most expensive ruby ever. The buyer’s identity was kept secret. Comment below if&nbsp;it’s you!</p><p>It&nbsp;isn’t just gemstones that cost a&nbsp;fortune. Here is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most expensive metals in&nbsp;the world&nbsp;— rhodium. It’s not as&nbsp;well-known and popular&nbsp;as, let’s say, platinum. But it&nbsp;is&nbsp;gradually becoming one of&nbsp;the hottest things on&nbsp;the market.&nbsp;80% of&nbsp;the demand for rhodium comes from the global automotive industry.</p><p>So, it’s wanted, but it’s super rare. Annual rhodium production is&nbsp;around 30&nbsp;tons. For comparison, gold miners dig up&nbsp;between 2,500 and 3,000 tons of&nbsp;this precious metal every year. Now, you can see why rhodium is&nbsp;so&nbsp;pricey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/af6/e04/918bd855468a9b3d8820e61f9f.png><p>The term “gold nugget” makes me&nbsp;smile and feel hungry at&nbsp;the same time because it’s too close to&nbsp;chicken nuggets. Really? Yeah. Anyway, the world’s largest gold nugget is&nbsp;now older than a&nbsp;century.</p><p>Two miners found this huge chunk of&nbsp;precious metal in&nbsp;the gold fields of&nbsp;Australia in&nbsp;1869. It&nbsp;weighed 214 pounds and was 24&nbsp;inches long. The miners named it&nbsp;“Welcome Stranger.” These two people instantly became rich. In&nbsp;those days, you could turn into a&nbsp;millionaire overnight.</p><p>Nowadays, we&nbsp;have Lotto. Very unlikely but possible. One of&nbsp;the grandchildren of&nbsp;the miners said that when people heard her name, they always asked her where the gold was or&nbsp;if&nbsp;she was rich. She answered that she wasn’t. In&nbsp;fact, she didn’t even have any jewelry made from the Welcome Stranger. That’s a&nbsp;shame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8a1/99c/c719d55a479a1acb3c514a2ec4.png><p>Imagine you’re 12&nbsp;and find a&nbsp;diamond worth $15,000 while you’re walking in&nbsp;a&nbsp;park. This actually happened to&nbsp;Michael Detlaff. He&nbsp;probably used all his luck in&nbsp;life that day. Of&nbsp;course, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal park, you can see trees, leaves, rocks, and so&nbsp;on. But in&nbsp;the Crater of&nbsp;Diamonds State Park, you can find a&nbsp;real diamond.</p><p>This park is&nbsp;very special because it’s where eight of&nbsp;the largest diamond deposits in&nbsp;the world are located. And anyone&nbsp;— literally anyone! —&nbsp;can just go&nbsp;there and search for diamonds. And it&nbsp;gets even better. The policy is&nbsp;“finders, keepers.” So&nbsp;yeah, just go&nbsp;find yourself a&nbsp;diamond there. You might even turn out luckier than Michael Detlaff. And he&nbsp;found the 5.16-carat diamond after less than a&nbsp;minute search!</p><p>Have you seen the largest orange diamond ever sold at&nbsp;auction? It&nbsp;was bought for 35&nbsp;and a&nbsp;half million dollars in&nbsp;2013. This is&nbsp;about $2.4 million per carat, which is&nbsp;the highest price per carat paid for a&nbsp;colored diamond at&nbsp;auction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f83/7e7/e14ca156d18f66c3b4eb5f741e.png><p>Miners have recently discovered the largest pink diamond found in&nbsp;more than 300&nbsp;years. The diamond has the nickname “Lulo Rose,” which comes from the Lulo mine in&nbsp;northeastern Angola. The pink diamond weighs 170&nbsp;carats. Right now, the largest pink diamond in&nbsp;the world is&nbsp;the 182-carat Daria-i-Noor from the Iranian collection of&nbsp;national jewels. But the newly discovered Lulo Rose is&nbsp;almost as&nbsp;large. Pink diamonds are relatively rare, too.</p><p><a href=# title=Science data-link=tag>Science</a> can’t fully explain what gives the gem that rosy hue. Hey maybe they’re shy, or&nbsp;embarrass easily. But the fact is&nbsp;that they are worth a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money. In&nbsp;1999, miners in&nbsp;<a href=# title="South Africa" data-link=tag>South Africa</a> uncovered a&nbsp;rough 132-carat pink diamond, later called the Pink Star. In&nbsp;2013, the Pink Star was sold for approximately $83 million at&nbsp;auction. This way, it&nbsp;became the most expensive gemstone ever sold.</p><p>In&nbsp;2000, miners found a&nbsp;gigantic jade stone in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Canada data-link=tag>Canada</a>.&nbsp;18&nbsp;tons! They wanted to&nbsp;keep the stone, but then they got a&nbsp;generous offer. The buyers wanted to&nbsp;turn the huge piece of&nbsp;jade into a&nbsp;Buddha statue. Eventually, the stone was carved into a&nbsp;statue weighing 4&nbsp;tons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/789/633/7f1c515af0bbc8237bd944230d.png><p>You might be&nbsp;sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;fortune hidden under your house or&nbsp;in&nbsp;the backyard. Every now and then, people discover strange and valuable things on&nbsp;their property. This is&nbsp;what happened to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lucky gem trader in&nbsp;Sri Lanka.</p><p>He&nbsp;had problems with the water supply, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;well drilled in&nbsp;his backyard. Workers found a&nbsp;2.5 million-carat sapphire cluster there. It&nbsp;weighed more than 1,000 pounds and was worth around $100 million on&nbsp;the market. Well that should fix his water supply.</p><p>We&nbsp;talked about rare black opals, and&nbsp;I can’t help but mention opal pineapple. It’s one of&nbsp;the rarest and most fascinating types of&nbsp;opal. It’s not a&nbsp;fossilized fruit or&nbsp;something like that. Only the shape of&nbsp;this cluster of&nbsp;crystals resembles that of&nbsp;the pineapple. These “Opal Pineapples” are only found on&nbsp;the White Cliffs in&nbsp;Australia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/48b/ef1/15f8fd52b2b613bdb8b961bb2c.png><p>If&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;gold nugget, there should be&nbsp;silver nuggets, too, right? And they do&nbsp;exist! In&nbsp;fact, the largest silver nugget ever mined was found in&nbsp;the United States. It&nbsp;weighed 1,853&nbsp;pounds. It&nbsp;was too large to&nbsp;be&nbsp;carried in&nbsp;one piece, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was cut into 3&nbsp;pieces and moved from the Smuggler Mine near Aspen Colorado in&nbsp;1894.</p><p>Look at&nbsp;this sparkling purple gemstone. The Empress of&nbsp;Uruguay is&nbsp;the largest amethyst geode in&nbsp;the world. That’s a&nbsp;hollow rock with thousands of&nbsp;perfect crystals that formed inside. This geode is&nbsp;130 million years old. It’s 11&nbsp;feet high and weighs 2.5&nbsp;tons!</p><p>Imagine extracting something that big from the soil! It&nbsp;took miners 3&nbsp;months to&nbsp;take it&nbsp;out from the solid basalt which surrounded&nbsp;it. What would you do&nbsp;if&nbsp;you found something as&nbsp;precious as&nbsp;these treasures?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH53edGaqZ6rpGKur7CMpqasrF2axbGxzaygr51doravtc2gZJ%2BhnpnAboSQbmtxbV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-we-shouldnt-squat-over-the-toilet-when-we-pee-809626.html><span>←</span><span>Why We Shouldnt Squat Over the Toilet When We Pee</span></a>
