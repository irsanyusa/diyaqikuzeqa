In fact, people thought his name was <strong>Shabalistica. </strong>Such is the power of catchy tags; they can create an identity for producers and create healthy expectations with fans who recognize the tag.</p><p>However, some tags are better and catchier than others. This <strong>Pulse Nigeria</strong> article aims to celebrate the top producer tags in Nigeria, by how catchy they are, how they aid the music and how big of a signature they are.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-4>Here are some of the best producer tags in Nigeria;</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>15.) Higo</h2></p><p>Tag: Higo (whispered)</p><p>Rating: 4.5/5</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It might only be whispered, but you will notice it and <strong>Higo</strong>'s amazing work, most notably for <strong>PrettyboyD-O.</strong></p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>14.) Tochi Bedford</h2></p><p>Tag: Young Tochi Keep Mobbin’ - the female version</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Rating: 4.5/5</p><p>There are two versions of this tag by Bedford, a member of the collective, <strong>44DB. </strong>The one he currently uses is delivered in a sped up fashion by a man, but the old one was more sensual and delivered in a female voice. You can catch it on <strong>Odunsi</strong>’s amazing <a href=# id=382dee81-10b9-46a4-abed-ed00ab022942>Everything You Heard Is True EP.</a></p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-17>13.) Ransombeatz</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tag: Ransom got that sauce innit?</p><p>Rating: 4.6/5</p><p>While the voice of a man randomly saying “Ransom got that sauce innit” might seem random, it’s become a signature for one of Nigeria’s most recognizable producers on Obasanjo’s internet. He’s also cashing out and has even<a href=# id=715610d1-6417-4eef-8961-39f60c3b455e> produced a Billboard hit</a> for <strong>Tekashi 6ix9ine.</strong></p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-23>12.) BeatsByJayy</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tag: BeatsByJayy</p><p>Rating: 4.7/5</p><p><a href=# id=f4a81690-1aca-4a96-9e29-224300721d60>BeatsByJayy</a> is Nigeria’s number one Hip-Hop producer for a lot of reasons, but his tag almost has as big an identity as his work as a producer for <strong>AQ, Blaqbonez, Monster Verse, LAMB Cyphers, MI Abaga, Teeto Ceemos </strong>and more. His tag is a female voice saying “BeatsByJayy” and then moaning in the most sensual way.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-29>11.) Spax</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tag: If it's Spax then it gotta be a hit</p><p>Tag: 4.7/5</p><p>Spax is one of Nigeria's leading producers. In 2020, he broke out of the <strong>Show Dem Camp </strong>box into more mainstream circles with songs for <strong>Blaqbonez </strong>and <strong>Oxlade. </strong>His tag seems basic, it's such an identity. Like many producers, many people recognize that tag and not him.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-34>10.) Dunnie</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tag: Legend o!</p><p>Rating: 4.7/5</p><p>The only woman on this page, she has gone from having a stern male voice saying “Oladunni, the beatmaker” to the more distinct chant, “Legend o!”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You might not know this, but <strong>Dunnie </strong>produces her own music and continues to make strides across the continent, producing for <strong>Busiswa, Childish Major, Focalistic, Sho Madjozi, Wande Coal </strong>and more.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-41>9.) Kukbeatz</h2></p><p>Tag: Kukuruku!</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Rating: 4.7/5</p><p><strong>Kukbeatz </strong>has been around for a minute, but most people would have recently noticed him <a href=# id=56611727-1bff-47df-a759-6c7f61eccc26>on Ruger’s debut EP</a>. The tag sees a female voice say “Kukuruku” is the most bougie way ever.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-47>8.) Maze x Mxtreme</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tag: Dig This!</p><p>Rating: 4.8/5</p><p>You might not know them, but they have been doing great things in the <a href=# id=88f46867-07fc-45d1-9e70-ffd0548b6d25>Nigerian EDM underground</a> with ace remixes to your favourite hits. They also released their debut single in 2020. The tag is delivered in a warped male voice with authority.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-53>7.) Tempoe</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Rating: 4.8/5</p><p>The tag was different until 2010, but since then <strong>Tempoe </strong>has become the MAD! Man, producing hits for <strong>Omah Lay, Joeboy, Blaqbonez </strong>and more. Already, he’s on an upward trajectory with the aid of <strong>Stephanie Okocha </strong>and <strong>Dvpper Dam. </strong>The sky's the limit.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-59>6.) Illeri XO</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tag: Big Fish!</p><p>Rating: 4.9/5</p><p><strong>IlleriXO </strong>is known for producing a ton of Abuja-based acts.

Ragee</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tag: Initiating, Rage Process</p><p>Rating: 5/5</p><p>Like Magic Sticks, <strong>Ragee</strong> is not as popular as his producer tag. But already, he’s known for producing records for "Have Fun" for <strong>Bad Boy Timz</strong>, "Shedi Bala Bala" for <strong>Jerry Shaffer</strong> and more. The tag is delivered in a warped out male voice with Eastern European-esque accent.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tag: Tune in to the king of songs and blues</p><p>Rating: 5/5</p><p>Most people don’t know <strong>Magic Sticks, </strong>but they recognize his tag. If you type the tag into your Twitter search bar, you’d find evidence of the recognition. Already, he’s produced by <strong>Ryan Omo, DJ Neptune </strong>and more.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-75>3.) MI Abaga</h2></p><p>Tag: Coin Toss</p><p>Rating: 5/5</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>A lot of people know MI Abaga is a music person through and through. He’s a great rapper, but he might be an even better producer. Most people don’t realize that any record that holds that coin toss is his producer tag, but it is. It can be heard on <a href=# id=aaf3fda0-e0c4-4939-b6c6-f2e0d8643ca2>Yxng Dxnzl</a><strong> </strong>and <a href=# id=bb0e9e57-768c-405b-a77c-27328aff3542>‘The Viper.’</a></p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-81>2.) Killertunes</h2></p><p>Tag: Shabalistica</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Rating: 5/5</p><p>As noted earlier, in 2018, Nigerian producer <strong>Killertunes</strong>’ tag was more popular than his name. In fact, people thought his name was <strong>Shabalistica.</strong></p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-87>1.) Pheelz</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Rating: 5/5</p><p>At some point, <strong>Pheelz </strong>used <strong>Pheelz Mr. Producer. </strong>At some point in 2018, he went on a hiatus and came back with <strong>DJ Enimoney</strong>-inspired tag, <strong>Riddimacoolayor! </strong>The tag means the rhythm is cool.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2S1pr7EZpirnV2pvLF5kG5kpqejqXqzsdKopZqmpGK9s7vDrpqeql2prqi%2FjKKlZqaZnLKztcCnZKato56wbrXNZmlpamBksK60k6Ovrw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dolly-parton-broadway-musical-hello-im-dolly-1236026791.html><span>←</span><span>Dolly Parton Announces Plans for Broadway Musical Based on Her Life, Hello, Im Dolly</span></a>
