There’s also the issue of Social Security and Medicare, programs that Trump and Biden have urged the GOP to protect — and that DeSantis <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>has supported privatizing</a>, which could hurt him with older voters.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Others believe that the mere fact that he has some cross-ideological appeal could prove ironically problematic in a GOP primary. One Republican strategist with deep knowledge of the Florida electorate said the electability case could cause the party’s base to see him — as Trump recently described him —as an establishment “RINO” (Republican in name only) and to shirk lessons about candidate quality and electability from the GOP’s underperformance in recent election cycles.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">If that’s the downside for DeSantis, the upside is this: His electability argument is helpful with major Republican donors, according to a veteran GOP presidential campaign strategist not yet involved in the 2024 contest. That could help DeSantis limit the size of the candidate field — his <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>clearest pathway toward the party’s nomination</a> — especially given his strength with small-dollar donors who have been recently trending less generous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">That still doesn’t account for Trump, who has already raised salacious claims about the Florida governor’s past and is getting the keys back to his money-raising platform on Facebook.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In the eyes of the strategist in Trump’s orbit, DeSantis should worry that the former president — who claims to have been instrumental in building his political rise — will try to drag him down with him if he falls next year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZMGzsc2dZKydpKmys7%2BOnZysmZ6ptrR5y6impKtdoryzsYyeo56bpJavrbGMrZ%2Bapl2pv7a5z2aYoJmZo8C1ecGim56m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prime-de-fonction-et-de-resultats-des-effets-long-terme.html><span>←</span><span>des effets long terme ?</span></a>
