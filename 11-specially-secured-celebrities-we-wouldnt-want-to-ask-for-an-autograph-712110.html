Beyoncé and Jay-Z</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a97/a66/9b29d552958a975d01a8bd8a42.jpg><p>This famous married couple has been attacked by&nbsp;their fans multiple times. During their summer tour, On&nbsp;the Run, a&nbsp;drunk fan <a href=#>got on</a>&nbsp;the stage and scared the celebrities a&nbsp;lot, but fortunately, their bodyguards managed to&nbsp;capture the man quickly. It&nbsp;was after this incident that their security measures were tightened.</p><p>The couple surrounded themselves with <a href=#>500</a>&nbsp;bodyguards. They were tasked with protecting Beyoncé, Jay-Z, and their daughter 24/7, and about 300 people were in&nbsp;the crowd during their shows preventing dangerous accidents. And about 50&nbsp;people usually watch the stage. In&nbsp;their regular life, they are protected by&nbsp;3&nbsp;bodyguards, including <a href=#>Julius DeBoer</a> who is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most famous bodyguards in&nbsp;the world.</p><p><h2>2. Tom Cruise</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/34b/f90/da18c256b8b1e00bd76bede891.jpg><p>“<a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a>” is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the <a href=#>most searched</a> people on&nbsp;Google. Because he&nbsp;knows how popular he&nbsp;is, the <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> actor surrounds himself with the best bodyguards. For example time, Tom Cruise, his wife, and his daughter were protected by&nbsp;the charismatic <a href=#>Sean Ringgold</a>, who later became an&nbsp;actor.</p><p>Another of&nbsp;his popular bodyguards is&nbsp;<a href=#>Mark “Billy” Billingham</a>. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;former sniper and SWAT officer, and he&nbsp;protects the actor together with his team.</p><p>Tom Cruise’s illustrious career, spanning over four decades, has firmly cemented his status as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>Hollywood icon</a>. Born in&nbsp;1962 in&nbsp;New York, Cruise’s passion for acting emerged during his teenage years in&nbsp;Cincinnati. His early roles in&nbsp;films like “Endless Love” and “Taps” paved the way for his breakout performance in&nbsp;“The Outsiders.” The 1980s saw Cruise rise to&nbsp;superstardom with hits like “Top Gun” and “Rain Man.” The subsequent decades witnessed his continued dominance at&nbsp;the box office, with the “Mission Impossible” series being a&nbsp;notable highlight. As&nbsp;the 2020s dawned, Cruise showed no&nbsp;signs of&nbsp;slowing down, with “Top Gun: Maverick” and upcoming “Mission Impossible” sequels in&nbsp;the pipeline. With plans to&nbsp;film in&nbsp;space in&nbsp;collaboration with SpaceX, Cruise’s legacy is&nbsp;set to&nbsp;reach astronomical heights.</p><p><h2>3. Angelina Jolie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5da/a82/8977815120875af6eb03def606.jpg><p>The famous mother of&nbsp;6&nbsp;has 3&nbsp;bodyguards. For a&nbsp;long time, the children were protected by&nbsp;Mark “Billy” Billingham who later became Tom Cruise’s bodyguard. After many long years of&nbsp;working with the actress and her children, he&nbsp;and <a href=# title=Jolie data-link=tag>Jolie</a> became so&nbsp;close that he&nbsp;even became her <a href=#>confidant</a>. He&nbsp;supported Jolie a&nbsp;lot during her divorce with Brad Pitt. The cost of&nbsp;Jolie’s security is&nbsp;more than <a href=#>$</a><a href=#>2 million</a> annually.</p><p><h2>4. Rihanna</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/557/b75/4cc8a85866be40193779482ce8.jpg><p>During official events, <a href=# title=Rihanna data-link=tag>Rihanna</a> always has 5&nbsp;bodyguards who wear elegant suits. On&nbsp;regular days, she prefers to&nbsp;have 2&nbsp;guards with her. It’s known that she has an&nbsp;informal and friendly relationship with her bodyguards. Sometimes, they carry her on&nbsp;their backs when she is&nbsp;tired or&nbsp;when it’s <a href=#>snowing</a>. And they also <a href=#>put her</a> on&nbsp;their backs during parties and concerts.</p><p><h2>5. Kendrick Lamar</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/597/b94/aabc365680b01184ad790f052c.jpg><p>The famous rap singer rarely appears on&nbsp;magazine covers and he&nbsp;generally tries not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;public. But in&nbsp;the few photos that you can find online, you will <a href=#>see</a> the singer with 3&nbsp;big men who are protecting him. Last summer, during a&nbsp;walk in&nbsp;Australia, <a href=# title=paparazzi data-link=tag>paparazzi</a> took a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;Lamar surrounded by&nbsp;his bodyguards. Now we&nbsp;know that he&nbsp;has nothing to&nbsp;be&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;when there’s a&nbsp;bodyguard like <a href=#>this</a> near him.</p><p><h2>6. Lady Gaga</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/413/e6e/dc2a1557819b94a4aaa5054730.jpg><p><a href=# title="Lady Gaga" data-link=tag>Lady Gaga</a> has millions of&nbsp;fans, and some of&nbsp;them are really obsessed with her. So, when the singer appears in&nbsp;any public place, she is&nbsp;always surrounded by&nbsp;4&nbsp;tall men wearing black suits.</p><p>They often <a href=#>stop</a> the fans who rush toward the celebrity to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;get an&nbsp;autograph. However, aside from being effective, the singer also values the image of&nbsp;her bodyguards. <a href=#>Pete van der Veen</a> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her former bodyguards who worked for her for many years. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bodybuilder and in&nbsp;2005, he&nbsp;won a&nbsp;beauty contest.</p><p><h2>7. David and Victoria Beckham</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4e/642/fcdb245281ab2fba45726357a5.jpg><p>This famous married couple is&nbsp;extremely popular, which is&nbsp;why they always have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;surrounded by&nbsp;bodyguards. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;his children from school, David has to&nbsp;<a href=#>drive</a> a&nbsp;bulletproof Rolls-Royce with 2&nbsp;cars full of&nbsp;guards. The soccer player himself <a href=#>said</a> that he&nbsp;dreams of&nbsp;walking down the street with his family, without other people around, but he&nbsp;realizes that his family’s safety comes first.</p><p><h2>8. Britney Spears</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/881/b7c/b8cac553df8599dd4d56a4394f.jpg><p>Bodyguards protect the singer from over enthusiastic fans and photographers 24/7. In&nbsp;2014, Spears was so&nbsp;scared that she would be&nbsp;stalked by&nbsp;her ex-boyfriend that she <a href=#>tightened</a> her security. She even hired 2&nbsp;more people to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=#>on&nbsp;guard</a> every day.</p><p>She asked them to&nbsp;keep an&nbsp;eye on&nbsp;the guy since he&nbsp;was not allowed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the same town as&nbsp;her. Spears is&nbsp;known for having a&nbsp;difficult demeanor, so&nbsp;many people who’ve worked for her have complained about how difficult it&nbsp;was that they had to&nbsp;<a href=#>deal</a> with her strange decisions and help solve all her problems.</p><p><h2>9. Jennifer Aniston</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/443/2cb/66f9ee5ba4a488b3a6c4938f6b.jpg><p>Jennifer is&nbsp;always surrounded by&nbsp;security. When she goes shopping, she is&nbsp;always <a href=#>accompanied</a> by&nbsp;her bodyguard who never takes his eyes off her. When she is&nbsp;outside, she is&nbsp;always <a href=#>with</a> 3&nbsp;male bodyguards who protect her from annoying photographers and fans.</p><p><h2>10. Drake</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/551/d66/baddb05b6ebb79211851228702.jpg><p>The multiple bodyguards of&nbsp;the famous musician have a&nbsp;controversial reputation. They are <a href=#>ready</a> to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;the rapper’s safety. They even fight with fans and photographers. And since December 2018, Drake has tightened the security because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;conflict with Kanye West who lives nearby. Additionally, the security team <a href=#>put</a> a&nbsp;huge bulletproof car near his gate.</p><p><h2>11. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b4/8da/893dfe571abd105695dcde1c5d.jpg><p>After a&nbsp;<a href=#>robbery</a>, the famous couple has <a href=#>tightened</a> their security. Now, Kim walks and travels together with her 3&nbsp;bodyguards. West, who used to&nbsp;walk alone or&nbsp;only with one bodyguard, is&nbsp;now also <a href=#>surrounded</a> by&nbsp;big men. Now, they travel in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bulletproof car and their security <a href=#>costs</a> them around $1.5 million annually.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these celebrities amazed you the most with their approach to&nbsp;their personal security?</p><p>Angelina Jolie’s <a href=#>decision to&nbsp;adopt</a> her first child, Maddox, from a&nbsp;Cambodian orphanage marked the beginning of&nbsp;her journey as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother. Maddox’s adoption not only changed his life but also sparked Jolie’s maternal instincts and her commitment to&nbsp;underprivileged children worldwide.</p><p>Celebrating their son RZA’s first birthday, <a href=#>Rihanna</a> and A$AP Rocky shared adorable photos of&nbsp;their family, melting hearts across social media. The rapper posted various pictures, including one of&nbsp;him shaving while holding RZA, highlighting his pride as&nbsp;a&nbsp;father. A&nbsp;close source revealed that Rihanna is&nbsp;thoroughly enjoying motherhood, stating, “She is&nbsp;the happiest she has ever been.” The couple is&nbsp;also expecting their second child, adding another layer of&nbsp;excitement to&nbsp;their lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yedKpnJyhkaG5unnSnpquqpWZeqSxy56Zq6GknrK0edaeZLCnpaGxr8CMsJinrF2pvG6t0qRkn6eiYq6vecCuq6ifopa9qXmWamlqaWBk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./usher-past-present-future-tour-opener-concert-review-1236113816.html><span>←</span><span>Usher Dazzles With a Wild Career-Spanning Journey on Opening Night of His Past Present Futu</span></a>
