Since 2016, however, he has been incarcerated in the United States.</p><p>Born into poverty, Guzmán entered the drug trade first by growing opium poppies which his father sold. After starting his own organisation with some friends and eventually being kicked out of the house by his father, Guzmán went into business in earnest. He quickly rose through the ranks, working with prominent figures like Héctor Luis Palma Salazar and <a href=#>Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo</a>.</p><p>Guzmán founded his own cartel in 1988 and oversaw the production and smuggling of drugs into the United States and Europe. He pioneered the use of tunnels and distribution cells, which allowed him to evade authorities and expand his empire. At the height of his power, Guzmán was considered one of the most influential people in the world, with a net worth rivaling that of <a href=#>Pablo Escobar</a>.</p><p>Despite his success, Guzmán was first arrested in 1993 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, but escaped in 2001. After being recaptured in 2014, he escaped again in 2015 through a tunnel. His final arrest came in 2016, after which he was extradited to the United States where he was found guilty of multiple charges and sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>Guzmán has been married multiple times and had a number of children, many of both his wives and children were involved in the drug trade. His third wife, for instance, Emma Coronel Aispuro, was arrested in 2021 for her role in his cartel and escape plots.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>April 4</a>, <a href=#>1957</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> La Tuna, Sinaloa, Mexico<br><b>Age: <a href=#>67 years old</a></b></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Baby Boomer</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Rooster</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Aries</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Articles and Photos</h2><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/photos/el-chapo-captured.jpg width=270 height=166 alt="El Chapo Finally Recaptured" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>El Chapo Finally Recaptured</h3><span class=linked_text>Mexican drug lord Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán in American custody after being extradited to the United States</span><br><span class=linked_date>January 8, 2016</span></a></li></ul><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2001-01-19</a> Mexican drug lord Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán escapes from Puente Grande maximum-security prison near Guadalajara by bribing prison guards and hiding in a laundry cart</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2015-07-11</a> Mexican drug lord Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán escapes from Altiplano maximum-security prison west of Mexico City via a specially constructed 1.5 km tunnel from his cell to a nearby house</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2016-01-08</a> Mexican President <a href=#>Enrique Peña Nieto</a> announces the recapture of drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, six months after he escaped prison</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2017-01-19</a> Mexican drug lord Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán is extradited to the United States to face trial for his leadership of the Sinaloa drug cartel</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2018-11-13</a> Trial of Mexican drug lord Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán begins in New York, he is charged with drug trafficking, money laundering, and murder</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2019-01-15</a> Witness in El Chapo trial claims former Mexican President <a href=#>Enrique Peña Nieto</a> accepted $100 million bribe from the drug cartel head</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2019-02-12</a> Mexican drug lord Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán found guilty of all 10 federal crimes against him in New York after 200 hours of testimony</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2019-07-17</a> Mexican drug cartel head Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years in New York</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2021-02-22</a> Wife of drug cartel boss "El Chapo" Emma Coronel Aispuro arrested in the US on drug trafficking charges and conspiring to free her husband from prison</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2021-06-10</a> Emma Coronel Aispuro, wife of drug lord El Chapo, pleads guilty to helping run his criminal operations and aiding his 2015 prison escape</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2021-11-30</a> El Chapo's wife Emma Coronel Aispuro sentenced to three years in the US for helping run her husband's drug cartel and aid his escape from prison</li></ul><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Gangsters</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwsctmmqGZoKQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20601-how-will-jd-wetherspoon-fare-after-social-media-ax.html><span>←</span><span>How will JD Wetherspoon fare after social media axe?</span></a>
