Caterina Scorsone</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/502/3e7/90623356f491d8034370d33add.jpg><p>The Canadian-born <a href=#>Grey’s Anatomy</a> star has a&nbsp;cute baby daughter named Paloma that is&nbsp;always present in&nbsp;the <a href=#>39-year-old actress</a>’ social <a href=# title=media data-link=tag>media</a> feed. Paloma was born with <a href=# title="Down syndrome" data-link=tag>Down syndrome</a> and since her birth in&nbsp;2016, Caterina has become a&nbsp;prominent voice on&nbsp;social media for raising awareness about the condition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/603/f9d/fa20735961a8aa1b2104cdbe7d.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her <a href=#>interviews</a> Caterina makes powerful statements about her daughter. She says: “Pippa is&nbsp;different. So&nbsp;are you and so&nbsp;am&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Pippa has needs that are specific to&nbsp;the way her body was made. I&nbsp;have needs that are specific to&nbsp;the way my&nbsp;body was made. We&nbsp;all&nbsp;do.” She confesses that she was scared at&nbsp;the beginning, as&nbsp;she didn’t know anything about this condition, but later she <a href=#>felt</a> that Pippa’s difference lit a&nbsp;match in&nbsp;her life and in&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;her family.</p><p><h2>2. Amanda Booth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/130/74c/b093ba5ed09a9632ba20d584c0.jpg><p>Model, mom, and advocate <a href=#>Amanda Booth</a> has been working to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;much-needed change in&nbsp;the media and <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> industries, thanks to&nbsp;inspiration from her son Micah, who has Down syndrome and <a href=# title=autism data-link=tag>autism</a>. Amanda <a href=#>says</a> she first started to&nbsp;notice this need when she went back to&nbsp;work after giving birth to&nbsp;Micah. “I&nbsp;started to&nbsp;notice when&nbsp;I would go&nbsp;out for things for work, that there would be&nbsp;babies at&nbsp;castings all the time. And I&nbsp;was like, ’Why isn’t anybody asking for my&nbsp;baby at&nbsp;these castings?’” she recalls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1a4/d6d/2f7491563b9f62c80b19ff6897.jpg><p>Booth <a href=#>says</a> one of&nbsp;her many favorite things about Micah is&nbsp;his ability to&nbsp;sense kind-heartedness in&nbsp;others. She calls him a&nbsp;barometer that brings out the kindness in&nbsp;everyone when he&nbsp;walks into a&nbsp;room. Amanda works really hard to&nbsp;help the world see a&nbsp;more diverse beauty, and she is&nbsp;not afraid to&nbsp;answer other people’s questions about her son’s condition. She says she is&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;explain why her kid is&nbsp;stimming or&nbsp;not behaving not like anybody else, and she does it&nbsp;willingly and for everyone who is&nbsp;interested.</p><p><h2>3. Toni Braxton</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Toni</a> gave birth to&nbsp;her second child, Diezel, in&nbsp;2003. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;3&nbsp;he was diagnosed with autism. She learned the programs on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;develop and educate her son, gave her child all the love she had.</p><p>Today, Diezel Braxton is&nbsp;an&nbsp;in-demand model who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>signed</a> a&nbsp;contract with one of&nbsp;the world’s leading modeling agencies and is&nbsp;rapidly gaining popularity as&nbsp;an&nbsp;Instagram star.</p><p><h2>4. Sylvester Stallone</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39b/fee/ae17f1503990a58ab74ec40844.jpg><p>When someone hears the name <a href=# title="Sylvester Stallone" data-link=tag>Sylvester Stallone</a>, they immediately think of&nbsp;Rocky: a&nbsp;tough man with an&nbsp;even tougher heart. Stallone’s son, Seargeoh, was diagnosed with autism at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age, and this is&nbsp;what his father had to&nbsp;<a href=#>say</a> about it&nbsp;all; “We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;accept Seargeoh the way he&nbsp;is&nbsp;and understand that his way is&nbsp;just quieter and reserved.”<strong> </strong><a href=#>Seargeoh</a> appeared in&nbsp;<a href=#>Rocky&nbsp;2</a>, as&nbsp;Rocky’s newborn son.</p><p><h2>5. Katie Price</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e3c/fca/434b915c418c3b8442183b9887.jpg><p><a href=#>Katie Price</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very successful and beautiful model, and she is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;mom. Her son, Harvey, was born in&nbsp;2002 and he&nbsp;has been diagnosed with Autism, blindness, and Prader-Willi Syndrome. One of&nbsp;the biggest concerns with this condition is&nbsp;that the child lacks the ability to&nbsp;tell when they are full, so&nbsp;they keep eating. This can lead to&nbsp;obesity and type 2&nbsp;diabetes, each having its own medical side effects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/34c/805/263b9a5d47957fb9eda6188f39.jpg><p>But Katie has been overcoming all of&nbsp;the troubles and pitfalls together with her son, and now she proudly says on&nbsp;her <a href=#>Instagram</a>: “I’ve watched you grow into a&nbsp;handsome man. My&nbsp;Harvey bear&nbsp;I love you, and wouldn’t change you for the world.”</p><p><h2>6. John McGinley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d0b/f20/b17d2054eb86155663e58202f0.jpg><p>The famous actor <a href=#>John McGinley</a> has a&nbsp;son named Max who has Down syndrome, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;actively involved in&nbsp;building awareness and being an&nbsp;advocate for people with Down syndrome. In&nbsp;2011, John received the Foundation’s Quincy Jones Exceptional Advocacy <a href=#>Award</a> for his work related to&nbsp;people with Down syndrome and people with developmental disabilities in&nbsp;general.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cec/039/78d8fe5873944ed52841561493.jpg><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, he&nbsp;<a href=#>explains</a> what it’s like to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;special needs child: “The first couple of&nbsp;months, it&nbsp;felt like we’d been hit over the head with some kind of&nbsp;cosmic hammer... And sooner or&nbsp;later you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something, you have to&nbsp;pick some aggressive verb about what you’re gonna do&nbsp;for this life. For Max. ’You gotta do&nbsp;something for&nbsp;me, get over your stuff, dad, I’m here.’”</p><p><h2>7. Colin Farrell</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/142/cba/5445465fb3ae0af2adacb6ad19.jpg><p>Who knew Hollywood’s bad boy was a&nbsp;father to&nbsp;a&nbsp;child with special needs? <a href=#>Colin Farrell</a>’s son, James, suffers from a&nbsp;genetic condition called Angelman Syndrome. This condition can cause jerky movements. Colin has done a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;work with the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome and <a href=#>says</a>, “When you’re the parent of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child with special needs, it’s important to&nbsp;feel that you are not alone.” That is&nbsp;the reason he&nbsp;started working with the foundation.</p><p><h2>8. Christopher Gorham</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b1f/094/2f94785e74af62cffea65fa159.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Ugly Betty</a> star <a href=#>Christopher Gorham</a> has a&nbsp;son named Lucas who was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome around the age of&nbsp;<a href=#>9</a>. “It’s upsetting to&nbsp;hear that something is&nbsp;wrong with your child,” he&nbsp;said about the diagnosis. “At&nbsp;the same time, it’s a&nbsp;relief to&nbsp;know what’s wrong with your child because if&nbsp;you know what’s wrong then you can start to&nbsp;take steps to&nbsp;help them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/08f/c11/51ae2e5d08bc9fb591191c3742.jpg><p>Christopher noticed that his son was getting more and more distant from his peers in&nbsp;the second grade, and that’s when they had to&nbsp;face the diagnosis, and since then he&nbsp;and his wife have been busy with his therapy. Gorham <a href=#>says</a> that he&nbsp;feels for all parents who have kids with special needs, as&nbsp;he’s been going through a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;changes and stress. But he&nbsp;sees the positive side of&nbsp;this trial, as&nbsp;his wife, according to&nbsp;his words, turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;real superhero in&nbsp;coping with this.</p><p><h2>9. Gary Cole</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/502/aa3/cf996e55069fcc7c73792eb720.jpg><p>Actor <a href=#>Gary Cole</a> first suspected that his daughter Mary was special when she was 2&nbsp;years old. “She didn’t process information like you or&nbsp;I&nbsp;do, and did not pick up&nbsp;on&nbsp;social cues,” <a href=#>he&nbsp;says</a>. She was diagnosed with autism, but has led a&nbsp;normal life. She was provided with therapy and help from a&nbsp;personal aide, which helped her to&nbsp;attend regular elementary and middle schools in&nbsp;California. Gary’s advice to&nbsp;parents who may have special children&nbsp;is: “Seek answers, and the earlier&nbsp;— the better.”</p><p><h2>10. Jenny McCarthy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9bd/004/1a1d5450939667e4fd415a009a.jpg><p>When Evan, her son, was first diagnosed with autism, <a href=#>Jenny McCarthy</a> says he&nbsp;stopped speaking and began ignoring the world around him. Because, <a href=#>according to&nbsp;her</a>, that’s what most autistic children do&nbsp;— they get locked inside themselves. However, she was determined to&nbsp;help him recover. So&nbsp;she began looking for treatments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/542/8f0/7bb832583ba6841f263d6be9dd.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the things she did was to&nbsp;fix the family’s eating habits, she also tried video modeling and play therapy to&nbsp;teach him how to&nbsp;play with toys, and it&nbsp;turns out that her “warrior spirit” did indeed help Evan. According to&nbsp;Jenny, Evan has made great strides. “He’s doing amazing,” she <a href=#>says</a>. “He’s considered recovered.”</p><p>Have you ever taken care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;special child?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xecKeo56aop7BqrHSZq6hp6OaerS8xJygmqRdmLWquMOrnKdlpJbCqLTTZquhnZ1irm7Dx6ijnmWUnrOnsdGepa1lm567pXnOn2Slp6aaenl8kGpscWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./social-media-qanon-poll.html><span>←</span><span>1 in 4 Social Media Users Say QAnon Conspiracy Theories Are at Least Somewhat Accurate</span></a>
