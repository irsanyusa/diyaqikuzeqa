While no serious injuries have forced anyone out of the competition yet, several participants have faced their share of physical challenges on the dance floor.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-every-injury-on-dwts-season-32>Every Injury on DWTS Season 32</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-xochitl-gomez-s-halloween-night-accident>Xochitl Gomez‚Äôs Halloween Night Accident</h3><p>On DWTS‚Äò Halloween episode, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Xochitl Gomez</a> found herself in an unfortunate situation. Following her contemporary dance, it was clear that she was in pain. Despite the discomfort, Xochitl assured the judges that she was okay. She later shared the details of her injury on her Instagram Stories.</p><p>In her post, Xochitl explained that she got scraped up while climbing an altar during her performance. Although she had a bandage around her knee to conceal the injury, she didn‚Äôt appear to let it slow her down.</p><p>While her knee injury was the most noticeable, Xochitl also mentioned experiencing pain in her wrist and rib. Fortunately, after treatment by an energy healer, these issues seemed to subside. Her friend, Charlie Goldsmith, a celebrity healer, was in the audience to support her and even helped alleviate her discomfort. In the comments section of a post, Xochitl expressed her gratitude to Goldsmith for helping her recover.</p><p>Following Xochitl‚Äôs Halloween night mishap, she was injured in Music Video Night‚Äôs camera blocking session. In a video she shared to TikTok, fans can see the Marvel actress fall after a spin. After posting the video, Xochitl assured fans that she will be fine to take the ballroom, but she will be dancing on a sprained ankle.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>i have chills watching this. poor xochitl <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WsWxlfqWI4</a></p>‚Äî Gaby üçÇ (@jonahsdove) <a href=#>November 6, 2023</a><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daniella-karagach-sprains-her-ankle>Daniella Karagach Sprains Her Ankle</h3><p>Ahead of Music Video Night, Daniella Karagach had to sit out of rehearsals with her partner Jason Mraz.

She was unable to be on her ankle for an extended amount of time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Xochitl isn‚Äôt the only contestant to experience an injury on Season 32 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a>. Vanderpump Rules star, Ariana Madix hurt her foot early in the competition. She was seen wearing an ace bandage and sneakers for one of her performances.</p><p>In an interview, Ariana explained that she was dealing with an injury to her right foot. This foot injury didn‚Äôt prevent her from continuing in the competition, and she was determined to power through the pain.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mira-sorvino-s-hand>Mira Sorvino‚Äôs Hand</h3><p>Oscar-winning actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mira Sorvino</a> also faced an injury during her time on the show.
