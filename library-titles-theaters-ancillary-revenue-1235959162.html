Per the plan, Kaleidescape would sell the hardware and supply the prepped content, while content owners and exhibitors would negotiate their deal directly.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Data suggests classic rereleases could bring welcome ancillary revenue to studios and theaters, which would offer these titles during off-peak hours.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The results of a 2022 Cinema Foundation survey suggests there’s interest in this model. Per the findings, 64% of respondents said they were interested in theatrical presentations of films from cinema’s Golden Age (i.e., 1939’s “The Wizard of Oz”)&nbsp;, 66% in films from the ’70s, 69% in movies from the ’80s and 73% in film from the ’90s. More than 50% of respondents who described themselves as&nbsp;“non-active” theatergoers were interested in films from each of these periods, as did those considered “frequent” moviegoers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A unique touchpoint is the 2023 rerelease of Jonathan Demme’s Talking Heads concert movie “<a href=#>Stop Making Sense</a>,” which <a href=#>outperformed</a> its initial run. The music doc made $5.4 million worldwide when it opened in 1984 and $6.9 million when it was reissued by A24 last fall, also spawning <a href=#>sold-out Imax</a> shows and a star-packed <a href=#>tribute album</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A recent example suggests that creative tie-ins with current films could be good business. The <a href=#>September 2022</a> rerelease of James Cameron’s 2009 blockbuster “Avatar” — presented as anticipation was growing for that December’s release of&nbsp;sequel<strong>&nbsp;</strong>“Avatar: The Way of Water” — made $76 million, according to Box Office Mojo. (“Avatar” remains the highest-grossing movie of all time, with a total of $2.9 billion worldwide.)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cameron also&nbsp;had success&nbsp;with the <a href=#>25th-anniversary</a> release of “Titanic” in 2023, which generated $70 million. Other recent&nbsp;reissues&nbsp;include Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Godfather,” whose <a href=#>2022 rerelease</a>&nbsp;generated $4.2 million, and Steven Spielberg’s “Jaws,” which made $6.4 million during its own&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>2022 run</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As for Kaleidescape, the company is starting a pilot program for its new service with Alamo, Brenden, B&B Theatres, Cinema West, Classic Cinemas, Epic, Megaplex and Star Cinema Grill. COO Priscilla Morgan reports that Kaleidescape has signed its first major studio content provider, though she declines to name the studio.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BrtrF7y6KZq5mirnq1tdOlnKxlpJ2yosDEq6pmmZ6Ytq24wKuwZqqVq7KvwcRmaGtrZW6Cen2Va2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-christopher-lambert-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Christopher Lambert Make?
