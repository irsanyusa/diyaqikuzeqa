During her 13 years with NMPA, she has played legal Whack-a-Mole with many companies and emerging technologies, serving as a key player in the negotiation, drafting and passage of the Music Modernization Act to address licensing for streaming services, and paved the way for more than $2 billion in royalties being paid out since 2021.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>AI’s existential threat:</strong> “I think it’s OK to press pause and say, ‘Are we doing this in a way that’s ethical, that doesn’t hurt humans, including human creators?’ ” she says.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Raney Aronson-Rath&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RaneyAronson_Variety.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Editor-in-chief & EP, “Frontline”;&nbsp; producer,&nbsp;“20 Days in Mariupol”</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The editor-in-chief and exec producer of “Frontline” teamed up with Associated Press journalist-filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov on “20 Days in Mariupol,” a first-hand look at the atrocities in Ukraine following Russia’s invasion, securing a modest Oscar campaign budget after the film made the doc shortlist. Her efforts paid off in March when the film won the trophy. “I was so pleased that cinematic journalism was recognized by the Academy,” Aronson-Rath says. “It was one of the most gratifying moments of my career.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>So much more to tackle:</strong> “We have crises happening all across the world and the geopolitical situation is shifting and changing — that’s something that we really want to capture in our upcoming documentaries.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Sara Bernstein&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Bernstein-Sara.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>President, Imagine Documentaries &nbsp;</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sole head of Imagine’s doc division since early 2023, Bernstein has this past year shepherded a slew of documentaries including “Stormy” and “Frida,” with Ron Howard’s doc “Jim Henson Idea Man” to debut May 31 on Disney+. “I’m most proud of the breadth, scope and range of the projects that we have been able to produce over the last 12 months,” she says. “The question in my mind is always, ‘How can we continue to push the form?’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Credit where it’s due:</strong> Bernstein salutes colleagues Kelsey Field, Meredith Kaulfers and Erica Fink, saying, “I couldn’t do this job without them, and we wouldn’t be Imagine Documentaries without them.

NBC again led all networks in total viewers last year, with “The Voice” and “Saturday Night Live” among standout shows. At the strikes-delayed Emmy ceremony in January, Peacock took home a casting trophy for unscripted hit “The Traitors.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Creative outlook:</strong> “There’s certainly a reset happening post-COVID, strikes and the streaming explosion,” Berwick says, predicting “a surge in fresh, original ideas after some overreliance on the familiar of known IP, franchises<br>and reboots.”&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Emily Blunt&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Blunt-Emily-GettyImages-2005974886-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Actor, “Oppenheimer,” “The Fall Guy”</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As a co-star of Christopher Nolan’s $970 million-grossing “Oppenheimer,” Blunt surfed a tidal wave of success in 2023 — even before her performance netted one of the film’s 13 Oscar nominations. She’ll follow that critical and commercial success with David Leitch’s action rom-com “The Fall Guy” and Benny Safdie’s mixed martial arts drama “The Smashing Machine.” “Schizophrenic flip-flopping between tones and genres” feeds Blunt’s creativity, even if it seems discordant career-wise. “I want to feel excited, and a shred of terror in me as well,” she says. “If you’ve got butterflies in your stomach, you’ve got to let them flutter forever, because they will see you through.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Debora Cahn&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Cahn-Debora.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Showrunner, “The Diplomat”</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Having previously worked on successful shows including “The West Wing” and “Homeland,” Cahn was convinced she would be able to avoid making mistakes as a first-time showrunner for Netflix’s “The Diplomat.” Not so. “Of course, I still made every mistake, but at least I knew that I was making it,” Cahn says. Her goal: to tackle international diplomacy much like “West Wing” feasted on domestic governance, with plenty of U.K. location porn and a spiky dynamic between Keri Russell’s ambassador and Rufus Sewell as her fellow diplomat husband to add frisson.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Unsung heroes: </strong>“It’s been really fun to introduce an audience to some characters we don’t usually see,” says Cahn, who recently finished filming Season 2 after a long break during the SAG-AFTRA strike. “But they are, in fact, the frontlines of democracy.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Eva Chen&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chen-Eva.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Global fashion partnerships, Meta &nbsp;</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">During her eight years at Meta, Chen has seen Instagram evolve from a square-image format into a multi-cam media experience, with the launch of Instagram Stories, Reels and more. She has also strategized with representatives across the fashion industry on how to use Threads in an effective manner. Chen has also authored nine children’s books to date, including the New York Times bestseller “Juno Valentine and the Magical Shoes.” &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Lesson learned: </strong>“The biggest mistake that I’ve made in the past — and also others probably make — is measuring success by tasks done.

MacCallum moved into her new role in January, overseeing digital products and developing a multimedia strategy to use data science including machine learning and AI.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Unified front: </strong>MacCallum is helping CNN tackle the future by removing silos. “Previously, we had different divisions operating almost entirely independently,” she says. “We’re creating one CNN.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Nicole Compas&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Compas-Nicole-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partner, Ramo Law</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Compas joined Ramo Law nearly five years ago to open its New York office and quickly established it as a go-to for scripted and unscripted television, film and new-media productions, working with companies such as Push It Prods. (“The Upshaws”), Imagine Documentaries (“Lucy and Desi,” “Frida”) and the Jim Henson Co. She served as production counsel on five 2023 Emmy nominees (including “Bono & the Edge: A Sort of Homecoming,” “Judy Blume Forever” and “Wanda Sykes: I’m an Entertainer”) and several films that debuted at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival, including Concordia’s “Girl State.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Balancing act: </strong>“I think brands want to defer to the filmmakers because they want [the documentary] to be accepted as something that’s not just a long-form commercial,” she says.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Carrie Coon&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Coon-Carrie.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Actor, “The Gilded Age,” “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire”</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Coon starred in Season 2 of HBO’s “Gilded Age,” the latest “Ghostbusters” movie and two indies in addition to booking a role in Season 3 of “The White Lotus,” now filming in Thailand, while her actor-playwright husband, Tracy Letts, has tended to their two young children back home. For Coon, the appeal of her striving Bertha on “The Gilded Age” is clear: “She’s the bad guy, essentially,” the actor says. “Because of that she’s driving the action.” Fans of the show also enjoy Bertha’s strong marriage with Morgan Spector’s equally ambitious George. “They are on parallel tracks,” Coon says approvingly.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Abundance of riches:</strong> The actor revels in the diverse roles she has been able to play alongside women of her own age recently. “I didn’t even know if that was possible,” she says. “That’s the dream.”&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Samantha Cox&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Cox-Samantha.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>VP, creative, New York, BMI &nbsp;</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At BMI, Cox has worked to further the careers of artists ranging from Lady Gaga (whom she knew in her pre-persona days as Stefani Germanotta) and Bebe Rexha to rising country/hip-hop star Tanner Adell, who sings on Beyoncé’s “Cowboy Carter” album.

Guest and Ringwald, recently in “Dahmer,” a relative outlier as Johnny Carson’s ex, Joanne. For Sevigny, a longtime New Yorker who pored over images of Capote and his so-called swans growing up in Darien, Conn., it was a thrill to be filming at grand locations around Manhattan. “We wanted to celebrate old New York and a bit of that charm and glamour,” she says. “It was fun to be there doing it.” Ringwald was also aware of Capote, having performed in an adaptation of one of his novels when she was very young, and believes that, with Carson’s character, Murphy “really wanted somebody who was going to offer a contrast to all of those hangry women.” For all the veneer of perfection, “underneath there are major cracks and so many of them were in loveless marriages,” says Watts, who grew up outside the U.S. and wasn’t as familiar with moneyed 1970s society milieu as some of her castmates. “It’s sad, but it was a different era than it is now.” Adding to the melancholy: Treat Williams, who portrays Babe’s husband, unexpectedly died shortly after the production wrapped. &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Lessons in adulting:</strong> Ringwald credits late production designer and producer Polly Platt with boosting her spirit when she was trying to move on from teen roles in films such as “Pretty in Pink.” “She was like, ‘You’re going to have a really long career.

The multihyphenate, who worked in theater before directing her first film, drew upon her own experiences as a Korean immigrant while writing the story about the price of female ambition, and leaned heavily on veterans including producers Christine Vachon and Pamela Koffler, while making it. “It’s just always so hard to walk into something without the experience of having done it before,” says Song, now prepping “Materialists.” “They’ve made so many films before that you’re able to borrow their experience.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Anjali Sud&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Sud-Anjali-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>CEO, Tubi</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Since joining Tubi from Vimeo in August 2023, Sud has given the Fox-owned ad-supported streamer a major makeover.
