I deeply regret that my comments were perceived as adding to her distress. It was never my intention to cause any pain or disrespect. I am truly sorry."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-f0217fbc-97fe-476e-89ec-5ca56995bdcd data-caption="Page two of Yvonne Jegede's statement [Instagram/iamyvonnejegede]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/C3DktkpTURBXy9mMWFjY2JjOTM0MjU4YTk3NzdkNTA5MDg2YWQyYWU1ZS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNA9zCww></span><p>The actress went on to stress that the essence of her interview was to shed light on her new movie, adding that her statement was to highlight the cultural aspects of polygamy in our society.</p><p>"I want to clarify that my remarks about polygamy were meant to reflect its cultural context and to emphasise that how it is practised is crucial. My goal was to convey that polygamy is part of our culture, but what matters is how it is approached. Unfortunately, my message was lost in my articulation," she added.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Recall that during the podcast, Jegede stated that she saw no problem with Yul Edochie taking a second wife because most people come from polygamous homes themselves.</p><p>She had said, "You see this same Yul Edochie ehn, 99% of people that are abusing him on the internet are from second wives, third wives, fourth wives and even, fifth wives. Sometimes some of them come from wives they the family does not even know about, let's all stop being silly on the internet."</p><p>"Why are we cursing the guy? They would curse him and leave Ned Nwoko alone and say Regina Daniels is your prayer point and she's the only one that can advise you about marriage. These are the comments I see," she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGayrp%2Bju6Z5yZ6enpyVYq6xu8uonqKrlah6p7vRZp%2Beql2YvK65xKerrGWRl7y2wIyyrKVllZm8pLTInmSappRivbC42KCYprFfZ7%2BnvNByaw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taxe-denlevement-des-ordures-menageres-quels-changements-avec-la-loi-de-finances-2019-0.html><span>←</span><span>quels changements avec la Loi de finances 2019 ?</span></a>
