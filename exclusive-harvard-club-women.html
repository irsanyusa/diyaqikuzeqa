Such institutions are called “final clubs” because they are the last club a person can join before graduating. They’ve existed since the 19th century after Harvard placed a ban on fraternities.
“This has been a long decision-making process, which has been discussed since September of last year amongst the undergraduates,” Fox Club president Daniel Skarzynski wrote in an email, according to the Boston Globe."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
