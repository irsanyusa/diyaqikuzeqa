None of what he said is true,” she wrote.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rochkind and the author of the New York Post story did not immediately respond to Motto‘s request for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtb2NthXSBjqecsGWppL%2Bsec%2Boqq1lkpqutsDIn6ylZaekuqa6jJ2YraGenHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bat-out-of-hell-review-musical-1203292430.html><span>←</span><span>Off Broadway Review: Bat Out of Hell</span></a>
