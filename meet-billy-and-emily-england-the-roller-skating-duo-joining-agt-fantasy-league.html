While they’ve clearly been a force to be reckoned with, the main prize has yet to be given to them. Nonetheless, they’re not the kind to back down so easily. Billy and Emily England will compete in the newest spinoff of America’s Got Talent, AGT: Fantasy League. Let’s take a deep look of their history together.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billy-and-emily-have-been-skating-since-they-were-kids>Billy and Emily Have Been Skating Since They Were Kids</h2><p>Hailing from Birmingham, England, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Victor and Carmen Emilia Arata</a> are tightly bonded brother and sister. The pair began roller skating when they were six years old, as a way of their mother to encourage them to go outside their house. When it was raining, their mom would bring their furniture out of the kitchen so they could use the area as a skating rink.</p><p>Over time, Billy and Emily fell in love with the “grace and elegance of roller skating.” Deciding to pursue the sport as a career, the two joined Britain’s Got Talent season nine, impressing the judges during their audition. However, when they reached the Semi-Finals, their death-defying stunt failed to fascinate Simon Cowell. According to the music mogul, their performance wasn’t on par with their first time.</p><p>In 2017, they competed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent season 12</a>, unfortunately getting eliminated in the Semi-Finals. Two years later, they represented Britain on AGT: The Champions. However, their journey was short-lived as they were eliminated in the preliminaries after reaching the top three in the live audience super fan vote.</p><p>Billy and Emily continued their Got Talent journey when they represented Great Britain on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BGT: The Champions</a>. Later, they finished in 3rd place in week 4 of the Preliminaries.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-will-compete-on-agt-fantasy-league>They Will Compete on AGT: Fantasy League</h2><p>If there’s something that cannot taken away from the roller skating duo, it’s definitely their grit. Billy and Emily will once again grace the Got Talent stage, and they promise a performance that’s even better than their previous ones.</p><p>Last week, the sibling duo announced that they’ve been included in the Draft Pool of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT: Fantasy League</a>. Now, they are gearing up to show fans that they deserve to walk away as champions of the spinoff.</p><p>“It’s official we are back competing on Americas Got Talent Fantasy League. We are so excited and are working on things we have never done before and no one else would ever attempt. Sit back and be ready for the craziest, fastest skating you’ll ever see in your life!!!! We have a huge team working with us to create something next level. We cannot wait to blow you away,” they wrote.</p><p>If you want to witness Billy and Emily England’s journey on the spinoff, be sure to tune in on the show. America’s Got Talent: Fantasy League premieres Monday, Jan. 1 at 8 p.m. ET on NBC and will stream the next day on Peacock.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_AdamLambert_Kiss_AmericanIdol_viaPintrest-220x184.jpeg alt="Adam Lambert’s Best Competition Show Performances" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWSnrmtxYyapZ1llaK2rcWMnqWgpJGjsW7Ax55kq6ecobKzedKkmK2hnpx6pcHOZqGooZ6eu6h5wKCrZp6Ro8Giv9hmo56Zl6qycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-want-to-divorce-my-husband-because-of-his-birthday-gift-818862.html><span>←</span><span>I Want to Divorce My Husband Because of His Birthday Gift</span></a>
