They called on the FG to attend to more pressing concerns like the current prohibitive cost of clearing goods at the ports which have risen by over 40% in the last two months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr7a%2FyKecrKtfmbyusdKtoJxnk5e7bq3PqamorpWoerOxw66araGfo3qwsoycrKysn6LAbrLOq5yxZZSqwbp50ZqrnmWSrnpyhY6pqqBxlJiB</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./affichage-obligatoire-de-la-composition-des-menus-dans-les-cantines-en-route-pour-lexperimentation.html><span>←</span><span>Affichage obligatoire de la composition des menus dans les cantines : en route pour l'exprimentati</span></a>
