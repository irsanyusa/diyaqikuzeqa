Claudia used to be on John Legend’s team, but she was stolen by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Horan</a> in the Battles.</p><p>Next up was Huntley, who delivered a powerhouse rendition of Bon Jovi’s “Wanted Dead or Alive.” Huntley turned all four coaches’ chairs with his Blind Audition earlier in the season, before choosing to join Horan’s team.</p><p>Last to perform was Noah Spencer, who gave a gritty performance of The SteelDrivers’ “Where Rainbows Never Die” while playing guitar. Noah turned three coaches’ chairs in his Blind Audition, ultimately choosing to join Team Niall.</p><p>“How are you gonna decide, Niall?” Legend wondered during Noah’s performance, demonstrating just how amazing all three artists were.

She told Noah that he made her feel like she was “sitting on the back porch of my home.”</p><p>Horan said it was “the best Knockout I’ve ever seen on this show.” We’ll have to wait until Monday night’s new episode of The Voice on NBC to find out who Horan chose to keep on his team.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_TateMcRae_Kevin-WinterGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Tate McRae Announces ‘Think Later’ Album, Global Tour: Here’s How to Get Tickets Early" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57kmaYq6yZqMG0ecWinqGsXam8brfEnqdmrJiatrN50qmmrWWfo3q1scCmZKehkaG5brXNZquhnV2rvKqvxGacmqqcrnqzscuemKydXaC7sK%2FKqKytZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-ways-of-dealing-with-people-who-try-to-put-you-down-800964.html><span>←</span><span>8 Ways of Dealing With People Who Try to Put You Down</span></a>
