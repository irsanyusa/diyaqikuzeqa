The pair first met on&nbsp;a&nbsp;gay dating app in&nbsp;2012 and then started their close friendship. They bonded in&nbsp;the hope to&nbsp;help each other to&nbsp;“work through the gay thing”.</p><p>However, it&nbsp;soon became obvious to&nbsp;Jake and Sean that they fell madly in&nbsp;love. Nine years passed, and the young men became the proud fathers of&nbsp;triplets whom they welcomed with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;surrogate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e7a/789/7427ba5359b525d754f3c45458.jpg><p>The whole process was long and difficult for both men. They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that, “It&nbsp;actually took four people to&nbsp;bring our family here.” The couple started with finding an&nbsp;anonymous egg donor and then having the eggs fertilized.</p><p>Jake explains, “We&nbsp;did some testing so&nbsp;that we&nbsp;would know which of&nbsp;those embryos were girls and which were boys, and then we&nbsp;implanted one girl and one boy embryo&nbsp;— one of&nbsp;each of&nbsp;ours.”</p><p>“And that’s how we&nbsp;got triplets!” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adds</a> Sean. “One of&nbsp;our girls decided to&nbsp;split on&nbsp;us! Didn’t happen the way that we&nbsp;planned, and now we&nbsp;couldn’t imagine life any other way!”</p><p><h2>Sean and Jake became a&nbsp;real inspiration for many.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e37/65a/48d93d5416ae4b8fff35cf6c41.jpg><p>The couple’s heartwarming <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> about their road to&nbsp;three beautiful children has over 9&nbsp;million views!
