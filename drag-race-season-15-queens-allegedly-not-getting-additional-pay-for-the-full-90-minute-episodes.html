The news has caused an uproar among fans and contestants alike. Sparking discussions about fair compensation and communication between talent and production.</strong></p><p>It’s no secret that RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 15 looked like none other before. For the most recent season of the series, the show moved from VH1 to MTV, which resulted with a not-so-great runtime in the end. This series has always had 90 minute episodes, so many fans were disappointed to see the episodes shortened to an hour with commercials. Due to fan excitement, MTV has decided to release the 90 minute episodes on Paramount+ on August 9.</p><p>Since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount+</a>‘s announcement, a source has come forward to Pop Crave, suggesting that contestants were not made aware of this decision until moments before the public announcement. At the time, it was also admitted that contestants were not paid any additional funds for these episodes.</p><p>Since the announcement, Paramount+ and the show’s executive producers, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, have expressed excitement about the extended episodes. Nonetheless, the lack of additional compensation for the contestants has raised eyebrows. It also intensified the ongoing discussion about fair treatment and payment in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Fans are eager to witness the extended cuts, particularly to see Sasha Colby, who emerged as a fan favorite. Additionally, there is excitement about seeing queens who didn’t receive much airtime, such as Robin Fierce and Princess Poppy.</p><p>As the release date approaches, the spotlight remains on Paramount+ and the producers to address the issue of unpaid compensation for RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 15 queens. The controversy adds an unexpected twist to an otherwise celebrated season. As the Emmys approach and the show has been nominated for nine awards. Including Outstanding Reality Competition Program and also an Outstanding Host nomination for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RuPaul</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Talent agents of <a href=#>#DragRace</a> alum tell Pop Crave that the queens of Season 15 have not been paid any additional funds for the full 90-minute episodes coming to Paramount+ on August 9.</p><p>The contestants allegedly did not find out about the streamer’s decision to release the 90-minute… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gDLYso1aQ3</a></p>— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href=#>July 28, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Season 15 Episode Were Cut Down To Just 60 Minutes</h2><p>RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 15 originally aired this year, from January to April. With the fierce and talented <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Colby</a> emerging victorious and taking the crown. Colby’s stunning performances captivated audiences throughout the season. Including a memorable almost-nude act aimed at confronting Republican lawmakers’ attacks on trans people.</p><p>However, even before the season began, there was discontent among fans and cast members. This was when it was revealed that most episodes would be cut to just 60 minutes. This leaves only 40 minutes of actual content after factoring in advertisements.</p><p>For those who may not remember, the decision to shorten the episodes came after the show moved from VH1 to MTV. MTV then allocated space for a new reality TV show called Real Friends of WeHo to air after Drag Race. Some contestants, like Salina EsTitties, took to Twitter to voice their concerns, stating that they had worked too hard and invested too much money for such a condensed edit.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_TeresaGiudice_SofiaVergara-220x147.jpg alt="Teresa Giudice Calls Sofia Vergara the ‘Rudest Woman’ She’s Ever Met" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w6uYoGWilrCmedKemKynnmJ%2BdnnQrpyepqNirq24xKCcnaSpYruwwIygnK2smaO0bq3DnaCtoZ%2Bjrq15z5qwZp6fp3q1tMRmna6knGKGcXnMoqWurJVisrG10qibnqtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./egalite-femmes-hommes-une-circulaire-du-ministere-de-la-justice.html><span>←</span><span>une circulaire du ministre de la Justice</span></a>
