She started off with a cool cover of “Bad Girl” by Usher, and she even walked up to the judges’ table as part of the performance. Later, she sang a passionate rendition of “Lost Without U” by judge Robin Thicke, who said she made it feel like it’s supposed to feel. Firefly was emotional afterward.</p><p>At the end of the episode, host Nick Cannon announced that Firefly had been voted The Masked Singer Season 7 winner. Both Thicke and Jenny McCarthy correctly guessed that Teyana Taylor was under the mask. Nicole Scherzinger guessed that it was Monica, while Ken Jeong guessed Alicia Keys.</p><p>After she was unmasked, Taylor shared that she chose to do the show because she liked the idea of singing with “no judgment.” Cannon pointed out that her husband, <a href=#>NBA star Iman Shumpert</a>, recently won Dancing with the Stars. Taylor said she’d put the Golden Mask trophy next to his Mirrorball.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>‘THE MASKED SINGER’ RENEWED FOR SEASON 8, NO WORD YET ON RETURNING PANELISTS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ringmaster-prince-unmasked-in-finale>Ringmaster, Prince Unmasked in Finale</h3><p>Prince and Ringmaster also gave great performances during the finale. Prince started off singing an energetic cover of “Viva La Vida” by Coldplay. Unfortunately, because he was the first one voted out, he didn’t get to perform a second song.</p><p>Only Scherzinger correctly guessed that Prince was Cheyenne Jackson. He said he’s become more well-known for acting, but he started off singing. Jackson also shared that his daughter gave him a good luck charm (a rock that says “courage”) which he had sewn into his costume.</p><p>Ringmaster also brought her powerhouse voice to the stage for two performances. First, she sang “Gravity” by Sara Bareilles. Later, she brought the fun with “Waking Up in Vegas” by Katy Perry. Jeong called it a “star-making performance.”</p><p>None of the judges correctly guessed that it was Hayley Orrantia under the mask. Scherzinger told her she needs to record an album, to which she replied, “I’m working on it, baby.” She also shared that she was a contestant on The X Factor when Scherzinger was a judge.</p><p>That’s a wrap on The Masked Singer Season 7.
