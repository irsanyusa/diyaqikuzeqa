“The kid who had a&nbsp;good voice and no&nbsp;father.”
Barbra was born in&nbsp;Brooklyn, USA, in&nbsp;the early 1940s to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Jewish family. Unfortunately, she lost her father when she was too young to&nbsp;hold any memory of&nbsp;him."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Unfortunately, she lost her father when she was too young to&nbsp;hold any memory of&nbsp;him. Diana Ida Rosen worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;school secretary and met Emanuel Streisand, a&nbsp;grammar and literature teacher, whom she eventually married.</p><p>After the birth of&nbsp;their first child, came a&nbsp;baby girl, whom they named Barbara&nbsp;— she would later drop the “a” for her stage name. However, when Barbra was just 15&nbsp;months old, Emanuel tragically died after <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suffering an&nbsp;epileptic seizure</a>. The family was devastated, and Diana, along with her two children, moved into her mother’s house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/252/66a/2749e55bfa9b47e1eec9fdcf04.jpg><p>Barbra Streisand <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told Oprah Winfrey</a> that in&nbsp;school she was known as&nbsp;“the kid who had a&nbsp;good voice and no&nbsp;father.” Emanuel was a&nbsp;constant absence in&nbsp;her life, even in&nbsp;the toughest decisions of&nbsp;her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a>. She asked her mother why she never talked about her dad, and she said she didn’t want Barbra to&nbsp;miss him.</p><p>Instead, the presence that marked her throughout her life was that of&nbsp;her mother&nbsp;— a&nbsp;woman who was so&nbsp;broken by&nbsp;the death of&nbsp;her husband that she raised her without any affection and who became her fiercest critic.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;jealous mother and an&nbsp;indifferent stepfather</h2></p><p>Streisand has spoken openly about the lack of&nbsp;support she received from her mother and stepfather when she was young. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> with the <i>New York Times</i>, she recalled how her mother told her she was not pretty enough, and she would be&nbsp;better off becoming a&nbsp;typist. Streisand also revealed that she disliked singing in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;her mother because it&nbsp;always embarrassed her. “Other people were praising my&nbsp;voice, but my&nbsp;mother would say, ’It’s not good enough, it’s not strong,’” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>she confessed</a>.</p><p>Also, Barbra spoke about <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>the unkind treatment</a> she received from her stepfather, Lou Kind, who never liked her and made her feel like she was a&nbsp;horrible being when she was just a&nbsp;child: “I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;make him like me&nbsp;for a&nbsp;while. I&nbsp;tried calling him Dad and got him his slippers at&nbsp;night when he&nbsp;came&nbsp;in. I’d get down on&nbsp;my&nbsp;belly and crawl, so&nbsp;I didn’t walk in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV while he&nbsp;watched wrestling. But did he&nbsp;like&nbsp;me? No&nbsp;way.”</p><p>These experiences have shaped Streisand’s life and have led her to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;advocate for self-esteem and self-confidence and to&nbsp;fight against stereotypes of&nbsp;beauty in&nbsp;the entertainment industry.</p><p>Perhaps because she had become a&nbsp;widow so&nbsp;suddenly, Diana saw her daughter through frustration. Before becoming a&nbsp;secretary, she had been a&nbsp;soprano herself but was too shy to&nbsp;sing in&nbsp;public.</p><p>During an&nbsp;interview, Barbra was asked whether her mother might have been jealous of&nbsp;her career, and she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>answered</a> affirmatively: “Yes. And that was staggering for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn. She never praised me&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;face, but&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;feeling she praised me&nbsp;to&nbsp;other people. And she wasn’t a&nbsp;toucher. She never hugged me&nbsp;or&nbsp;said words like, ’I love you’. I&nbsp;just couldn’t please her, but&nbsp;I owe her my&nbsp;career.”</p><p>Barbra <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers</a> that after her father passed, they lived with her grandparents. She and her mother slept in&nbsp;the same bed and her older brother slept on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cot. They didn’t even have a&nbsp;living room.</p><p>Then her mother sent her to&nbsp;a&nbsp;camp she hated. When she went to&nbsp;pick her&nbsp;up, a&nbsp;man was sitting next to&nbsp;her mother. That’s how Barbra learned that her mom had remarried, and she would have a&nbsp;sister, Roslyn.</p><p>Barbra would sit on&nbsp;the stoops of&nbsp;her neighborhood and sing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;consolation. She was invited to&nbsp;sing at&nbsp;weddings and camps, but it&nbsp;was only <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;13</a>&nbsp;that her mother let her record a&nbsp;few songs. By&nbsp;16, she was living on&nbsp;her own and making her way in&nbsp;the entertainment world but was often told she was too ugly and should <a href=#>have a&nbsp;nose job</a>. When Barbra was&nbsp;18, she turned up&nbsp;to&nbsp;sing at&nbsp;a&nbsp;nightclub and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thought</a>: “This could be&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;big change in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.” And so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was, and since then her career has grown stronger.</p><p>Despite the harshness with which her mother treated her, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>she believes</a> she did love her, in&nbsp;her own way: “I’m sure she loved me&nbsp;in&nbsp;the way she knew how. For her, love was food. She didn’t encourage me&nbsp;to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actress&nbsp;— maybe she didn’t want me&nbsp;to&nbsp;experience rejection. She never thought&nbsp;I would make&nbsp;it.”</p><p>However, Barbra Streisand was able to&nbsp;turn this negative and sad part of&nbsp;her life into something positive and is&nbsp;now <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grateful</a>: “Today, I&nbsp;can look at&nbsp;it&nbsp;and&nbsp;go, ’Thank you, Mom,’ because if&nbsp;you had believed in&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;probably wouldn’t have amounted to&nbsp;what I&nbsp;am today, because&nbsp;I wouldn’t have had to&nbsp;seek your approval.” None of&nbsp;those sad situations affected her determination to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;star. Overcoming each of&nbsp;those conflicts may have given her the strength to&nbsp;<a href=#>find true love</a> and become one of&nbsp;the most prominent women in&nbsp;the entertainment industry.</p><p>Her achievements are extraordinary. Barbra is&nbsp;an&nbsp;American singer, actress, and director. She has had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;career</a> spanning more than six decades and has had success in&nbsp;multiple fields of&nbsp;entertainment. She is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the few artists to&nbsp;have been awarded an&nbsp;Emmy, a&nbsp;Grammy, an&nbsp;Oscar, and a&nbsp;Tony. All were achieved through perseverance and a&nbsp;talent that has managed to&nbsp;shine brightly, leaving behind indifference and contempt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ybmKuaopZ6tMDRnqCsmZ6ZerW%2BwKeqn6eiorKlecKhoKWcmKS8pXnHmqmdq5ievbR5yKerqGWRYrCivsSeqWasmJbBbr%2FPmqWnnZRitKa6xKuYraGfo8BuhJBsaG9rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rosamund-pike-gone-girl-2-1201316673.html><span>←</span><span>Gone Girl: Rosamund Pike on the Role of a Lifetime</span></a>
