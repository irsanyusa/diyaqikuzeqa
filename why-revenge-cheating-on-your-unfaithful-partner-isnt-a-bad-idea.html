It is pretty much a way of saying ‘while I want to remain in this relationship, I want to go out and sample other people just as you have done.’</p><p>One of the easiest, most obvious things that has been said against revenge cheating is that two wrongs don’t make a right, and that the decision to go sleep with another person just to get back at a cheating partner only distresses the fabric relationship further.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-62618a40-4477-4f70-80c5-f208509f98af data-caption="Would you forgive a cheating spouse?"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/RVVktkqTURBXy9jMWQ3YjViMGUyNjJiYTBiN2Q2MTg3NjIxOTk0OTMyNC5qcGVnkZUCzQKAzQGfwsM></span><p>The strain put on the relationship by the initial cheating should have been enough, they say.
