I’ve been saying from the beginning it’s not just a moment, it’s a movement,” said Burke, an activist who founded the #MeToo movement in 2006 to help survivors of sexual violence. “Now the work really begins.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Twitter in October, Milano urged every woman who had ever been sexually harassed or assaulted to write “me too” as a reply to her tweet to “give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.” More than 1.7 million people immediately spoke out about their own harassment experiences after Milano’s tweet, she later wrote on Twitter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The call to action came as a wave of women in Hollywood — including Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow — came forward to accuse movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and other men in power of sexual assault or misconduct. At least <a href=# rel=noopener>74 public figures</a> have since faced accusations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Milano, who stars in the upcoming Netflix series <a href=# rel=noopener>Insatiable</a>, is credited with popularizing the movement Burke began more than a decade ago. “I could never imagine this,” Burke said about how large her movement has grown.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Milano said she was in bed with her sleeping daughter the night she sent out her “me too” tweet in October. She said her children are the inspiration for everything she does.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Wednesday, she called for companies to create a code of conduct and hire more women. She also urged women to “support each other” and men to be “part of the conversation.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“As women, we have to support each other and stand together and say, ‘That’s it. We’re done. No more,’” Milano said. “It’s vital to me that we really set in some actionable things that we can do to continue this momentum.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Every year since 1927, TIME editors have named a Person of the Year, recognizing the person or group of people who most influenced the news during the past year, for better or for worse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaGVmhXN%2Bjq2gpp1dpbKzv86nZLKdkad6orjYrKqaZZ2euaK6zmarmqqRo65urtSrop5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-stop-eating-bread-693860.html><span>←</span><span>What Happens toYour Body When You Stop Eating Bread</span></a>
