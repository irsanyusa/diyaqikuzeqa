<a href=../../../../50-trillion-income-inequality-america.html></a>
Like many of the virus’s hardest hit victims, the United States went into the COVID-19 pandemic wracked by preexisting conditions. A fraying public health infrastructure, inadequate medical supplies, an employer-based health insurance system perversely unsuited to the moment—these and other afflictions are surely contributing to the death toll. But in addressing the causes and consequences of this pandemic—and its cruelly uneven impact—the elephant in the room is extreme income inequality.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Best Portable Air Conditioners, According to an HVAC Expert</h2><time>Jun 16, 2024</time>

Whether you live in an area with a warmer climate year-round and are looking to supplement an existing ceiling fan or central air system, or are looking for a standalone air conditioning unit, a portable air conditioner can help. “Portable air conditioning units can easily be moved from room to room and do not look unsightly as a window unit sticking out the window,” says Chris Walters, HVAC expert, holder of Class A license in air conditioning and refrigeration in Texas, and owner of The Training Center of Air Conditioning & Heating based in Houston, Texas.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cancer Research UK popularity &amp;amp; fame</h2><time>Jun 16, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../google-search-engine-algorithm-bias-racism.html></a>
My first encounter with racism in search was in 2009 when I was talking to a friend who causally mentioned one day, “You should see what happens when you Google ‘black girls.’” I did and was stunned.
These are the details of what a search for “black girls” would yield for many years, despite that the words “porn,” “pornography,” or “sex” were not included in the search box. In the text for the first page of results, for example, the word “p-ssy,” as a noun, is used four times to describe black girls.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Happiness and How to Express it in English</h2><time>Jun 16, 2024</time>

A giant in the world of podcasting needs a “sonic signature.”
So when the prolific publisher Wondery decided it was time to brand its product by establishing an unforgettable signature, its leaders hired the creative-design firm, Made Music, behind the iconic static-screen clip that opens every HBO show. Wondery CEO Jen Sargent recalls that the branding exercise in 2018 helped the company fine-tune its vision of what Wondery podcasts should deliver to listeners.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Howie Mandel Wants to Set Sofia Vergara Up on a Date After Divorce</h2><time>Jun 16, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../married-people-cheat-so-much-in-lagos-and-its-no-longer-shocking-heres-why.html></a>
That cheating is bad is something that can’t possibly be said enough. But it appears that Lagos couples either don’t hear any of these or they just don’t subscribe to the idea of marital exclusivity. This is not to free cheats in other Nigerian towns and cities from blame and scorn, because they are also terrible, but the probability that they are anywhere close to the special specie of cheats in Lagos seems unlikely.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>13 Disney Princesses and the Actresses Who Voiced Them</h2><time>Jun 15, 2024</time>

It was Anika Noni Rose’s lifelong dream to work for Disney. “Since I was a little kid I wanted to work for Disney—and I didn’t need to be the Princess! I would have been a tick or a flea!” The Tony Award winning actress got her wish when she was chosen to voice Tiana in The Frog Princess. In 2011, Rose would also be inducted into the Disney Legends, a hall of fame for those who have made a significant impact on the Disney legacy.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/72/>← Prev Page</a>
