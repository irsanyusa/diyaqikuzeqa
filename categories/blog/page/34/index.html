<a href=../../../../loki-bisexual-mcu-lgbtq-representation.html></a>
It’s finally canon: the third episode of Loki confirmed that its titular character is bisexual, making him Marvel’s first canonically queer lead character. It took long enough. Loki made his debut in the MCU way back in 2011 and has been a mainstay in the universe for a decade, and yet fans are only finding out now that he is bisexual.
