He also brought some major attitude with him that he directed toward the judges. Take a look at his audition below that led to Simon Cowell giving him a serious attitude check on stage.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-curtis-moore-gets-attitude-check-from-simon-cowell-on-x-factor>Curtis Moore Gets Attitude Check From Simon Cowell on ‘X Factor’</h2><p>Curtis Moore lived in and out of foster care from the age of 12. When one of his brothers died, he spiraled out of control. He was charged with burglary and theft and went to his The X Factor audition wearing an ankle monitor. The teen also had a strict curfew. He said that he cooled down a lot since going down a bad path and that his life had “direction” at the time of his audition.</p><p>When Moore stepped onto the stage, judge Simon Cowell asked him what he had been doing prior to his audition and Moore raised his voice into the microphone several times, which left the judges a little gobsmacked.</p><p>“Sorry for asking,” Cowell muttered with a shocked expression.</p><p>“Let me sing now,” Moore insisted. He began singing “Let Me Love You” by Mario. After singing, Moore opened his eyes really wide with an odd facial expression directed toward Cowell, who let out a bit of a nervous chuckle.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>5 RUDEST AND ANGRIEST AUDITIONS EVER ON TALENT SHOWS</a></strong></p><p>Cowell asked Moore how he thought he did during his audition. When Moore replied with a snarky remark, Cowell decided to give him a reality check.</p><p>“We’re going to have a little conversation and it’s called attitude,” he said. “Seriously you’ve got to zip it and stop being such a smart ass. If you don’t want to be here you can go…because I really like you Curtis, but, you’ve got to listen to what people are saying.”</p><p>Cowell then complimented Moore’s swagger, but advised him to be able to take criticism. Despite the attitude problem, all four judges voted Moore through to the next round of the competition.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-he-now>Where Is He Now?</h3><p>While it looked like things were starting to look up for Moore, he was reportedly kicked off The X Factor after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a knife-wielding photo surfaced online.</a></p><p>Check out the compilation below featuring 10 of the rudest talent show contestants ever.

He recorded a version of &nbsp;“I Believe I Can Fly” and planned to donate the profits to the charity Sun and Happiness.</p><p>“I am ready to make this song a summer smash hit and raise as much money as I can for children who need help to find their wings,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Moore said in 2011.</a></p><p>Moore went on to release original music. The music video for his song “Lipstick” was released in 2014 and features the rapper Scorcher.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘X FACTOR’ JUDGE AND CONTESTANT THROW WATER ON EACH OTHER AFTER ARGUMENT [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>What did you think of Moore’s audition for The X Factor?</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Voice-of-Holland-Julia-van-der-Toorn.jpeg alt="‘The Voice Of Holland’ Singer Puts Her Own Spin on a Britney Classic" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The X Factor UK</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57kG9ksp2Rp3qwuMNmqqKml5q%2FbrPErapmmaSptrXBw55knKCVmLhustGopGarmaK8r3nCqK6epJxivK9512admpukpL9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./national-nurses-week.html><span>←</span><span>National Nurses Week: Celebrate With a LIFE Story on Nursing in 1938</span></a>
