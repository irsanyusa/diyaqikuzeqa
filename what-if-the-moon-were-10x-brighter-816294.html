But the <a href=# title=Sun data-link=tag>Sun</a> makes even Jupiter look like a&nbsp;joke.</p><p>That big burning ball in&nbsp;the sky is&nbsp;made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;hydrogen and helium and is&nbsp;<strong>864,000 miles</strong> in&nbsp;diameter, making it&nbsp;more than 100 times wider than our little blue planet.<strong> It’s 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit</strong> just on&nbsp;the surface and <strong>27&nbsp;million</strong> degrees at&nbsp;the core.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/d40/0cf/817cf15b18919f8e3eba813b5c.jpeg><p>The <a href=# title=Moon data-link=tag>Moon</a>, on&nbsp;the other hand, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;little easier to&nbsp;grasp at&nbsp;around<strong> 2,160 miles</strong> in&nbsp;diameter, which is&nbsp;only less than a&nbsp;third of&nbsp;Earth. It&nbsp;might seem pretty big floating in&nbsp;the sky, but that’s because it’s the closest object to&nbsp;us. But what if&nbsp;the tables, or&nbsp;in&nbsp;this case, celestial bodies, have turned, and the Moon suddenly became brighter than the Sun? Let’s explore several scenarios.</p><p><strong>Scenario 1&nbsp;</strong>If the Moon becomes brighter than the Sun, the nights will be&nbsp;brighter than days. It&nbsp;means your sleep cycle will be&nbsp;disrupted. All nocturnal <a href=# title=animals data-link=tag>animals</a> will be&nbsp;utterly confused. When is&nbsp;it&nbsp;time to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out and eat now? In&nbsp;the extreme North and South poles, the nights and days are for months on&nbsp;end, so&nbsp;people living in&nbsp;the area already have an&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;what it’s like to&nbsp;sleep at&nbsp;11&nbsp;PM with the Sun shining brightly above them. For the rest of&nbsp;us, it&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;easy.</p><p>Let’s say you’re out <a href=# title=camping data-link=tag>camping</a> and prepare an&nbsp;awesome meal, and gear up&nbsp;for the dark nights. As&nbsp;you trek into the forest, you find a&nbsp;spot that has an&nbsp;awesome view of&nbsp;the lake and the clear sky above. It’s 7&nbsp;PM, and you start a&nbsp;fire for some smores and get the telescope ready. The only problem is&nbsp;that when the Sun begins to&nbsp;set, the Moon lights up&nbsp;the sky even brighter. It’s surprisingly not as&nbsp;hot as&nbsp;you’d imagine since it’s not direct sunlight. But regardless, it’s still pretty hot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/b7e/eab/ad99135ad0885d216d09ea5a00.jpeg><p><strong>Scenario&nbsp;2 </strong>Temperatures will surely rise either way. That means snow will melt away faster than you can go&nbsp;“wait, what’s going&nbsp;on?” The snow on&nbsp;the polar caps will be&nbsp;the first to&nbsp;melt, followed by&nbsp;the polar caps. With so&nbsp;much heat, the sea levels will rise and take small remote islands scattered across the ocean underwater.</p><p>Coastal towns will go&nbsp;down, and everyone will live closer inward. This will likely cause a&nbsp;chain reaction in&nbsp;the world economy. There will be&nbsp;no&nbsp;more winters, which means no&nbsp;more winter activities like skiing, snowboarding, or&nbsp;snow fights. Animals and plants all around the world will be&nbsp;affected. The world will turn into a&nbsp;large desert. <a href=# title=Water data-link=tag>Water</a> will get scarce over the years, but people will find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;preserve&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c67/626/1e4e1a5d9684fc4450624a199c.jpeg><p><strong>Scenario&nbsp;3 </strong>You’re sitting behind your desk, bored. You’re losing business. People aren’t buying as&nbsp;many sunglasses as&nbsp;you thought. But then the Moon suddenly becomes brighter than the Sun, and everyone needs to&nbsp;wear these glasses 24/7 when heading outside. You can’t keep up&nbsp;with the demand for sunglasses, so&nbsp;you hire more people and grow your business.</p><p>You eventually become the best sunglasses business in&nbsp;the country. They don’t recommend looking up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the sky at&nbsp;any point of&nbsp;the day or&nbsp;night. Cities are covered with large visors to&nbsp;reduce the brightness every day. Sunglasses will come in&nbsp;different sizes and shapes for different times of&nbsp;the day. Some will be&nbsp;like goggles strapped around your head, while others will be&nbsp;like large helmets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/ae5/fa0/e3ba97575593b887508f46653f.jpeg><p><strong>Scenario&nbsp;4 </strong>The Moon’s atmosphere is&nbsp;so&nbsp;thin that it&nbsp;can’t contain anything in&nbsp;it. Just like over deserts on&nbsp;Earth, there are no&nbsp;clouds to&nbsp;bring some rain which is&nbsp;why it’s always hot or&nbsp;cold. Yeah, the biggest desert in&nbsp;the world is&nbsp;the whole continent of&nbsp;Antarctica which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cold, barren desert contrary to&nbsp;what people think of&nbsp;the Sahara Desert.</p><p>So, if&nbsp;you still want to&nbsp;land on&nbsp;the Moon, you better think twice now. People who are working at&nbsp;the International Space Station will have to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;new office. The Moon will be&nbsp;too bright to&nbsp;bare, considering how close they are. If&nbsp;the Moon is&nbsp;just brighter than the Sun without the heat part, then the Space Station will only require adjustments to&nbsp;keep the light out.</p><p>The reason why we&nbsp;see the Moon in&nbsp;various shapes is&nbsp;because of&nbsp;its position in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;the Sun. The Moon doesn’t rotate, unlike Earth. It’s kinda glued to&nbsp;us and is&nbsp;always showing the same side. So&nbsp;depending on&nbsp;the Moon’s position during the month, we’ll have a&nbsp;super bright night during the full moon and relatively shiny nights during the rest of&nbsp;the month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/ae4/25f/61e36e525e888048643669e67a.jpeg><p><strong>Scenario 5&nbsp;</strong>If the Moon became brighter than the Sun, it&nbsp;would produce more heat than the Sun and probably become larger. Gravity on&nbsp;Earth would change significantly because of&nbsp;the Moon’s new size. The whole orbit structure would change and affect the celestial objects floating in&nbsp;space. Plants would soon begin to&nbsp;orbit around the Moon. Earth might move further away from the Sun.</p><p>If&nbsp;that happened, then everything would have to&nbsp;readjust to&nbsp;the radical changes in&nbsp;gravity. Weak gravity means buildings wouldn’t have a&nbsp;solid foundation to&nbsp;sit on&nbsp;and would eventually collapse. Bridges and large monuments would also fail to&nbsp;hold&nbsp;up. People wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;walk properly and would do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;funny way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/097/7c2/4647b6561cac247b602418a7f7.jpeg><p><strong>Scenario 6&nbsp;</strong>In many of&nbsp;these scenarios, I&nbsp;mentioned how the Moon would just be&nbsp;brighter than the object emitting light. But in&nbsp;this case, the light would have to&nbsp;come from the Moon reflecting from the Sun, which means that the Sun would have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;twice as&nbsp;bright as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;now. If&nbsp;the Sun got 100 times bigger, it&nbsp;would shoot out more rays, which can be&nbsp;damaging and throw off a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;radiation, harmful to&nbsp;every living thing on&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>The gravitational pull of&nbsp;the Sun might attract more planets to&nbsp;orbit around it&nbsp;and cause other objects in&nbsp;space to&nbsp;join the orbit. The planets would be&nbsp;partying in&nbsp;our galaxy club, and we&nbsp;might be&nbsp;thrown off our orbit course. Of&nbsp;course, this would pose a&nbsp;bigger risk to&nbsp;everything on&nbsp;Earth as&nbsp;things would get hotter and drier than before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/5a9/438/4d1d195c6f944ce30e6bafc940.jpeg><p><strong>Scenario 7&nbsp;</strong>If we’re talking about the Moon getting brighter, we&nbsp;can also assume it&nbsp;would get closer to&nbsp;Earth than it&nbsp;is&nbsp;now. The brightness won’t be&nbsp;the problem here, as&nbsp;gravity will cause major changes on&nbsp;Earth. But every day 24/7 will be&nbsp;high-tide. It&nbsp;will be&nbsp;so&nbsp;extreme that there will be&nbsp;constant floods in&nbsp;every coastal town. All islands will be&nbsp;submerged, which will increase the population of&nbsp;inland cities. Marine life will be&nbsp;having the time of&nbsp;its life when water overtakes the land.</p><p>Boats will have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;reengineered for the new conditions as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;submarines. Air travel will be&nbsp;the priority, but large cruise ships will look futuristic and have an&nbsp;extra build to&nbsp;sustain the harsh waves. Nighttime will be&nbsp;pretty bright on&nbsp;regular days. It&nbsp;will raise the global temperature, which will melt up&nbsp;the snow causing the sea levels to&nbsp;increase even more. Comets and other celestial objects will be&nbsp;drawn to&nbsp;a&nbsp;closer gravitational pull, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;will always have to&nbsp;look up&nbsp;whenever we&nbsp;go&nbsp;outside.</p><p>But no&nbsp;worries! The Moon is&nbsp;still up&nbsp;there as&nbsp;it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;for a&nbsp;very long time. The Earth’s and the Moon’s relationship&nbsp;is... complicated. Luckily, we&nbsp;only have one natural satellite. Other planets in&nbsp;our Solar System have multiple moons revolving around them. Some are so&nbsp;huge that they’re the size of&nbsp;Earth. Imagine several of&nbsp;those affecting our home. But that’s a&nbsp;topic for a&nbsp;completely different story.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmoJ9lpJ2ybrnOqKVmr5Wnsm59j7Fkm6qZnLW1sdFmb2puYm6BcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./march.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened on March 5, 2024</span></a>
