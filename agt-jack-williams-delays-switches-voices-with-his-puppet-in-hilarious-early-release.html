Indianapolis born ventriloquist Jack Williams is set to take the stage on the third night of AGT auditions.</strong></p><p>On June 10, America’s Got Talent released Jack Williams audition early. On the stage, the Indianapolis native shared that he wanted to become a ventriloquist after seeing Terry Fator. Even though he has pretty big shoes to fill of the three previous winners, it’s clear Jack is up for the competition. He hopes America’s Got Talent will help him bring his ventriloquism to hte Las Vegas strip.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tiktok-ventriloquist-jack-williams-shocks-the-audience-by-throwing-his-voice-across-the-room>TikTok Ventriloquist Jack Williams Shocks The Audience by Throwing His Voice Across The Room</h2><p>As soon as Jack’s performance began, it was obvious that he is seasoned in the act. He took his puppet, Foster, out of the case and it totally came alive. From this performance, it’s obvious that Jack mixes stand up comedy with ventriloquism for his act. The entirety of the audition featured Foster and Jack joking back and forth about which of them is the better ventriloquist.</p><p>After the competition, Jack threw Foster’s voice across the room. When it came back, their voices totally switched. The reveal of the voices made the audience die of laughter. At the end of the audition, the audience and judges rose to their feet. Since the video cuts off before the judges speak, we can’t wait to see what they say about this act.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Ahead of America’s Got Talent, Jack has worked as a ventriloquist for over ten years. He has performed at clubs and theatres throughout the midwest, as well as the Los Angeles club circuit. If you’re an avid user of TikTok, you probably recognized them from the app.</p><p>In late 2021, Jack went viral for showing off how he can “delay” his voice while speaking. These <a href=#>videos</a> gained millions of views on the platform since he was able to use his ventriloquist tricks without a puppet. In present day he has 1.1 million followers on his puppet based TikTok. His current uploads feature him pronouncing tough words through his <a href=#>puppets</a>.</p><p>Tune into America’s Got Talent on Tuesday, June 14 to hear what the judges think of this ventriloquist. Could Jack follow the path of Terry Fator, Paul Zerdin, or Darci Lynne Farmer? Only time will tell.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1401888834-1.jpg alt="Who is Ryan Seacrest’s Girlfriend Aubrey Paige Petcosky?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZqKRmLhuw8ilo6KZnah6pbHLmrCsZaOstrWvx56qZq6fnrCmv4ywoK2gXZ22tHnPrqepnaRitq95x6KjmqqZpMK0ecSaqaWxXaeyrbHArJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spider-man-turn-off-the-dark-2-1117945452.html><span>←</span><span>Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark</span></a>
