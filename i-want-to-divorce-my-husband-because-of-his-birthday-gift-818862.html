We&nbsp;understand that things might be&nbsp;tough for you right now. We&nbsp;have some tips that you might find helpful.</p><p><h2>Let him know you were hurt.</h2></p><p>Your husband might have given such a&nbsp;gift with good intentions. Perhaps he&nbsp;thought you needed support, encouragement, and motivation. You could let him know that you’d prefer not to&nbsp;receive such gifts because they make you <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>uncomfortable</a>.</p><p><h2>Prioritize yourself.</h2></p><p>You might have been neglecting self-care because of&nbsp;work or&nbsp;other things. Focus on&nbsp;self-care and self-love, try doing activities and practices that make you feel confident and happy. Remember that your worth is&nbsp;not <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>defined</a> by&nbsp;your physical appearance, and prioritizing your well-being is&nbsp;important for a&nbsp;healthy <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with yourself and others.</p><p><h2>Tell him to&nbsp;stop.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you’re comfortable in&nbsp;your own skin and <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> your body, no&nbsp;one should make you think otherwise. Tell your husband that you won’t accept anything that somehow relates to&nbsp;your body and appearance. Explain that you won’t change just because he&nbsp;wants&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;truly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>loves</a> you, he’ll accept you for who you are.</p><p><h2>Think it&nbsp;through.</h2></p><p>Ask yourself why getting a&nbsp;divorce was the first thought that crossed your mind. You could have opted for couple’s therapy or&nbsp;chosen other options. However, you thought about ending the relationship so&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>abruptly</a> without working on&nbsp;it. Perhaps there’s a&nbsp;bigger issue, and the gift was just a&nbsp;catalyst. Maybe there’s something else you don’t like, and it’s not connected with the gift.</p><p>We&nbsp;all have our ups and downs, especially when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;relationships. Arguments are a&nbsp;normal part of&nbsp;the journey, but sometimes they escalate. <a href=#>Our reader’s</a> husband is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;talk her out of&nbsp;divorcing him, but she’s standing firm, and it’s really tough for her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuw8Cnq2asn2KxqsLOq5qeZZ2ueqnB0puYp5xdl7KkrdSsnGanlmK1qr%2BMm6CrrJiZrrp5xqKdrWVoZoV5gpFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dream-sequence-horror-podcast-blumhouse-television-iheartpodcasts-1236085952.html><span>←</span><span>Dream Sequence Scripted Horror Podcast Announced From Blumhouse Television, iHeartPodcas</span></a>
