Among the lesser-known threats are zoonotic diseases—illnesses that jump from animals to humans. These diseases can be particularly dangerous because they come with no warning and can spread rapidly, leading to severe health crises. Diseases transmitted from animals to humans are called zoonosis (pronounced zo-o-NO-sis). It can come from a variety of sources, including domestic pets, livestock, and wild animals. They start with close contact, but they can also spread through food, water, or even insects that have bitten infected animals.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>8 German philosophers you need to know</h2><time>Jun 23, 2024</time>

For example, Goldman Sachs recently announced they can price 20,000 bonds algorithmically, without a human trader. Salespeople and traders fear what this may bring. But while a lot has been written about the tech wave on Wall Street, it is not yet as ubiquitous as it is made out to be.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/66/>← Prev Page</a>
