Claudette Colbert (born Ã‰milie Claudette Chauchoin; September 13, 1903 - July 30, 1996) was an American stage and film actress and a leading lady in Hollywood for over two decades, and has been called "The mixture of inimitable beauty, sophistication, wit, and vivacity".

<a href=../../mad-about-you-2019-review.html></a>
Over the course of seven seasons that spanned most of the ’90s, Mad About You aired 164 episodes. I must have watched almost all of them, some multiple times, once the show went into syndication later in the decade. During those years, I was in junior high and high school; though as a rural teen I couldn’t exactly relate to its central couple—newlywed New York yuppies Paul and Jamie Buchman (Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt)—the sitcom’s upbeat, unobtrusive banter made it the perfect thing to put on in the background as I did homework or drifted in and out of wakefulness on a sick day.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Most Young Adults Have an Appetite for Binge-Watching Shows</h2><time>Aug 25, 2024</time>

The ways in which people engage with on-demand entertainment make the case for the ubiquity of binge-watching, despite marketing from streaming platforms aimed at monopolizing the word: Eighty-three percent of TV watchers report watching live TV at least once a week, including 69 percent of young adults. That number grows to 91 percent of those ages 55-64, and 94 percent of those 65 and older. Despite TV watchers’ preference for streaming services when it comes to on-demand viewing, streaming companies have a long way to go before they can overtake the stronghold of live TV, as suggested in a Nielsen report released in May.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>MUBI Acquires Additional European Territories on Ira Sachs Erotic Drama Passages in B</h2><time>Aug 25, 2024</time>

This reflects to some extent in form and technique the influence of the restless young Paris cinema colony, the environment in which the film was shot. But within its snappy, flashy veneer is an undernourished romantic drama of a rather traditional screen school.

<a href=../../metric-system-vs-imperial.html></a>
Measuring things allows us to describe the world in numbers. A measurement system determines characteristics such as size, length and distance, mass and weight as well as volume.
The metric system is widely adopted in the world and is therefore nearly universal. However, due to the reach of the English language, the imperial systems of Great Britain and the United States and their units of measurement are also well known, though they’re only in use in very few countries.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>30 Best Cooking Shows That Will Transform Your Home Cooking Into Michelin-Starred Restaurant</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>
