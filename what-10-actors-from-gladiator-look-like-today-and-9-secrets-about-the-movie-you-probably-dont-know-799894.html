Cameraman in&nbsp;the audience</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/702/edc/6059c5594cb3554d93bde10cde.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the biggest bloopers of&nbsp;the movie can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;the scene where Maximus fights his first battle in&nbsp;an&nbsp;arena as&nbsp;a&nbsp;slave. There you can clearly <a href=#>spot</a>, among the spectators, a&nbsp;man dressed in&nbsp;modern clothes and with a&nbsp;camera.</p><p><h2>2. Shoes that come from the future</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/219/0bf/465f825bb881ee3d9def3292c2.jpg><p>Something similar happens in&nbsp;the <a href=#>scene</a> where Maximus is&nbsp;fighting in&nbsp;the Colosseum in&nbsp;Rome. There you can spot one of&nbsp;the actors wearing modern <a href=# title=boots data-link=tag>boots</a>.</p><p><h2>3. George the horse</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a41/d21/1080d65177825ab70eea9e989e.jpg><p>The horse that Russell Crowe rides in&nbsp;Gladiator is&nbsp;the same as&nbsp;the one from the film, Robin Hood, and his name is&nbsp;George. Russell <a href=#>claims</a> that they had a&nbsp;special connection since the beginning and that when they met again 10&nbsp;years later for the filming of&nbsp;Robin Hood, when Russell went to&nbsp;greet George, he&nbsp;said, “Do&nbsp;you realize we&nbsp;won an&nbsp;Academy Award?” Crowe said jokingly —or not— that the horse did know.</p><p><h2>4. “Oops, I&nbsp;forgot to&nbsp;write a&nbsp;script.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/82b/380/b9e5c65bc186fac2ee801f8c02.jpg><p>During an&nbsp;interview with BBC, Gladiator’s lead actor, Russell Crowe, <a href=#>confessed</a> that the original script of&nbsp;the movie barely had 21&nbsp;pages when they started shooting. Normally, any given movie should have about 110 pages written before the filming process starts. Director Ridley Scott still had no&nbsp;idea how the movie would end, so&nbsp;the writers, the producer, and Crowe worked on&nbsp;the script together while shooting at&nbsp;the same time.</p><p><h2>5. Russell Crowe was shocked when he&nbsp;won the Oscar.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/365/ec6/f3e70359aba5483ff85c67f4ac.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the Academy Awards ceremony, when the actor’s name was called to&nbsp;receive the statuette for Best Actor, it&nbsp;took everyone by&nbsp;surprise, especially <a href=#>Russell Crowe</a>. Due to&nbsp;the conditions in&nbsp;which the film was shot (the fact that they had practically no&nbsp;script and some setbacks), the actor was astonished by&nbsp;the film’s success. Winning such a&nbsp;renowned award made Russell Crowe’s career really take off.</p><p><h2>6. Trained tigers</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/180/140/7e637f5ac2bdacfb87ddab7aef.jpg><p>You probably remember that amazing fight scene where Maximus has to&nbsp;defend himself against 5&nbsp;tigers in&nbsp;the arena. It&nbsp;turns out that, <a href=#>behind the scenes</a>, there was a&nbsp;veterinarian with tranquilizer shots. However, none of&nbsp;them had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used. Everything went well because the team was particularly careful and Russell Crowe stayed 15&nbsp;feet away from the tigers throughout the whole scene.</p><p><h2>7. The description of&nbsp;Maximus’ home</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc4/b0e/833f275959b5896af87fb17313.jpg><p>Just like mentioned earlier, most of&nbsp;the plot of&nbsp;the movie was pretty much improvised. That includes the memorable opening scene showing Maximus’ home. It&nbsp;turns out that Maximus’ description of&nbsp;his house in&nbsp;the film has the exact same layout as&nbsp;Russell’s house back in&nbsp;his home country of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a>. He&nbsp;also mentioned the smell of&nbsp;the kitchen, to&nbsp;give a&nbsp;moving feeling to&nbsp;the scene, which was actually <a href=#>improvised</a>.</p><p><h2>8. The real meaning of&nbsp;thumbs down</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/acc/3ab/f5ff2f580a832a68c895a80859.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the strangest fun facts from the movie. If&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;thumbs-down in&nbsp;modern terms, it’s pretty obvious for&nbsp;us that the emperor isn’t voting to&nbsp;save the life of&nbsp;the gladiator. In&nbsp;the same way, when the emperor makes the opposite gesture, today we&nbsp;understand that the gladiator should be&nbsp;forgiven. But actually, back in&nbsp;ancient times, it&nbsp;was exactly the other way around: thumbs up&nbsp;meant sword action, therefore the gladiator’s life would not be&nbsp;spared, and thumbs down, was meant to&nbsp;symbolize a&nbsp;sheathed sword, which would indicate mercy to&nbsp;the gladiator. The production team was fully <a href=#>aware</a> of&nbsp;this, but since today thumbs up&nbsp;is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;something positive, they decided to&nbsp;not confuse the audience with historical accuracies.</p><p><h2>9. Costume design</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae3/04a/e552dc548da150aa0d5c5a4c59.jpg><p>Janty Yates was the <a href=#>costume designer</a> of&nbsp;the movie and, together with her team, she was given the task of&nbsp;creating more than 10,000 era-appropriate costumes for the entire cast and extras.</p><p>For you, which was the best character in&nbsp;this film? Did you notice any other mistakes in&nbsp;the film?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmaGllkZjBsL7SZp2rp51itK2tw6KYraeiYrmwu8pmo6KjlWLBsLDAsmSappRihm6%2FxJypnqyjYq6ju9StZK2glWK6sMLInmSyp6VivbO7wZqZpbFdmbyvwIykpaivXWyGeoSYbWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-myth-of-the-hypoallergenic-dog.html><span>←</span><span>The Myth of the Hypoallergenic Dog</span></a>
