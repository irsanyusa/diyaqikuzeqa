You are my family.” He went on to thank his family and World of Wonder producers Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He shared a story about being “at the bottom” and sleeping on his friend Larry Tee’s couch. “He told me, ‘These are terrible times. Remember who you are, don’t give up.'” Speaking to the audience, RuPaul said, “I want to tell all these kids out here in the business, remember who you are. Do not give up. Stick with it, kiddo, and remember who you are.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With his win, RuPaul adds to his collection of awards, which includes the Tony Award he landed last year for producing the Broadway show “A Strange Loop.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">RuPaul beat out the hosts of “Queer Eye” (Karamo Brown, Antoni Porowski, Tan France, Bobby Berk and Jonathan Van Ness), “Nailed It!” (Nicole Byer), “Top Chef” (Padma Lakshmi) and “Baking It” (Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“RuPaul’s Drag Race” Season 15 was yet another historic season for the show: Winner Sasha Colby was the first Native Hawaiian queen to appear on the show, and was also the first winner of Polynesian descent.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The episode submitted for Emmys consideration was “Wigloose: The Rusical,” a parody of “Footloose” set in the small town of West Bumtuck, where drag has been outlawed.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The timely episode was conceived over a year ago. In that time, the U.S. saw a surge of anti-drag and anti-trans legislation, as well as ongoing hate crimes against the community. Producer <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://variety.com/2023/artisans/awards/rupaul-drag-race-anti-drag-trans-bill-timeliness-1235636111/>Tom Campbell said</a>, “We realized how timely it was, and it was so beautiful and important.” He added, “I don’t take it for granted and I’m not trying to be a scaredy cat. Sometimes people say ‘Oh, there’s too much ‘Drag Race’ or enough already. It’s like no, our existence could be put out like that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Click <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://variety.com/2024/artisans/news/2023-creative-arts-emmy-awards-winners-list-reality-unscripted-documentary-1235863738/>here</a> to see the full Emmys winners list.</p><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4><ul class="o-nav__list lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-flex lrv-a-space-children-horizontal lrv-a-space-children--050 lrv-u-align-items-center lrv-u-flex-wrap-wrap lrv-u-justify-content-center" aria-labelledby><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Creative Art Emmys,</a></li><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Emmys</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXOAjq2taKaVrMBwvtSpmK6kXaK8tMCMmq6aqpSasW60zqyrZqqVlrmqwNhmmqiloJrBqsDIqKVmnKKWtG6%2BwJycZp2dosa0eZFpaW1lYWeAdoSVbG5raV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./death-on-the-nile-filming-locations-1235172782.html><span>←</span><span>Was Death on the Nile Really Filmed in Egypt?</span></a>
