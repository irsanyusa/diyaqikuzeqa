This challenge is perhaps given to prove some auditionees’ versatility. Yet, while others were quickly taken aback by this request, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cristina Rae</a> has always been up for a challenge.</p><p>After her incredible rendition to Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight,” she sang “Gimme Shelter” by The Rolling Stones. At this moment, she didn’t only impress Cowell but also convinced judge Heidi Klum to press her Golden Buzzer.</p><p>“I think you are absolutely out of this world,” Klum said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Rae went all the way to the competition’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Finale</a>, placing third overall. This long AGT journey is no wonder, because Rae obtained a well-rounded education in the performing arts. She went to Nashville School of the Arts to study classical music and African dance. Subsequently, she enrolled in Fisk University, majoring in Dramatics, Speech, and Dance. Moreover, as she goes to the university, she juggles Orchesis Dance Company and the Jubilee Singers in her schedule.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Her Family Was Homeless</h2><p>At the outset of her audition, she genuinely revealed her saddening pasts. Apparently, she and her son Jeremiah experienced homelessness for a time, thus testing her resilience and determination to get through. Indeed, what ultimately keeps this powerhouse singer going is her young kid.</p><p>“He brings joy and love unlike anything else off of the stage,” her bio reads. “Jeremiah keeps me going and keeps me focused. He’s going to have everything I didn’t, consistent love being the #1 thing.”</p><p>After AGT season 15, Rae continued to pursue her passion in singing. She auditioned for the musical, Dreamgirls. Successfully, Rae secured the role of Effie White which included singing for Glee star Amber Riley. Aside from this, she won Amateur Night at the iconic Apollo Theater in New York City.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cristina Rae Comes Back for AGT All-Stars</h2><p>Last November, Rae surprised her fans when she <a href=#>announced</a> that she’s competing in AGT All-Stars. She’ll be among the 60 talented act vying for the winning placement in the said spin-off series.</p><p>Upon finding out the good news, fans are quick to intimate their support for the singer. Evidently, Rae is one to watch out in the competition. Fans cannot wait to see her again on AGT All-Stars.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_EmilandDariel_Casey-Durkin_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Meet Emil and Dariel, The Talented Cello Players on ‘AGT All Stars’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWTp7a0wMinmGaqkZp6tbTEZqannV2pvG6uxJqrZp6ipLpurcyeqaKbkah6qLvTZquapJWjwW6%2FxJqqqKZdZoJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./le-decret-sur-lencadrement-des-loyers-est-paru.html><span>←</span><span>Le dcret sur l'encadrement des loyers est paru</span></a>
