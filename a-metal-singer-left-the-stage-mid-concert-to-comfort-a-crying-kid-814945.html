However, the frontman of&nbsp;the metal band <i>Disturbed</i> proved they also have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> to&nbsp;give after stopping his concert to&nbsp;support a&nbsp;young girl who had burst into tears. The interaction was caught on&nbsp;camera, and the moment has gone viral.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/32e/446/14d3205a13878d44462cf599a3.jpg><p>Disturbed was playing live in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Florida</a> on&nbsp;August 3&nbsp;when, mid-show, the lead singer, David Draiman, noticed a&nbsp;young fan standing in&nbsp;the front row with her parents, singing her heart out along with the band. Draiman then decided to&nbsp;invite the girl to&nbsp;the stage, but, to&nbsp;his shock, she became overwhelmed and started crying.</p><p>The singer didn’t think twice before putting a&nbsp;halt to&nbsp;the music and hopping down from the stage to&nbsp;chat with the girl who introduced herself as&nbsp;Sophia. “I’m very proud of&nbsp;you. You’re awesome,” Draiman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Draiman continued to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;Sophia until he&nbsp;was sure she was no&nbsp;longer upset. “It’s okay, baby, it’s okay. I&nbsp;didn’t mean to&nbsp;scare you,” he&nbsp;said apologetically. “Are you okay? You promise? Oh, darling, you’re making me&nbsp;feel terrible now,” he&nbsp;added with an&nbsp;embarrassed chuckle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b9/a36/791ef65d9a8a4df13ad140cf10.jpg><p>Once he&nbsp;was sure the girl was indeed okay, he&nbsp;turned to&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;the audience. “See, I&nbsp;love, absolutely love, that Disturbed concerts have become a&nbsp;family affair. I&nbsp;love&nbsp;it,” he&nbsp;pointed out. “And this little girl has been singing her heart out the entire show. She knows so&nbsp;many of&nbsp;the songs,” he&nbsp;said before revealing that his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>9-year-old</a> son was also watching the concert.</p><p>The wholesome interaction was filmed, and the video ended on&nbsp;the band’s social media. It&nbsp;quickly went viral on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>TikTok</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram,</a> and people couldn’t help expressing their appreciation for the frontman’s kind act and the band’s inclusive stance. “Every single <i>Disturbed</i> show we’ve been to&nbsp;has made&nbsp;us tear&nbsp;up. They’re the best band I’ve seen live. Love them,” one user wrote on&nbsp;<a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a>. “Protect this man at&nbsp;all costs,” another fan wrote on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>.</p><p><h2>You can watch the full video of&nbsp;the interaction here:</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uucStmKVlo567qLHRZqOenqRiwamxjKyrmp%2BVYrqqsIycpqeblafBbsDOZpqopZakv7V5wGaaq7GZo7Rut8idZHFpZG6Bdns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1529607-who-eazy-es-kids-meet-late-rappers-11-children.html><span>←</span><span>Who are Eazy-Es kids? meet the late rappers 11 children</span></a>
