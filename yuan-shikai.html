He rose to prominence as a military modernizer and became the first president of the Republic of China.</p><p>Yuan began his career in the military, climbing the ranks and gaining recognition for his efforts to modernize China's armed forces. In 1898, he supported <a href=#>Empress Dowager Cixi</a> in a coup against reformers who sought to limit her power. This action solidified his position as a key figure in the Qing dynasty's government.</p><p>As the Qing dynasty weakened, Yuan negotiated its abdication in 1912. He met with the Empress Dowager Longyu to discuss the terms of the imperial family's departure from power. Following this, Yuan became the first president of the newly formed Republic of China.</p><p>Yuan's presidency was marked by increasing authoritarianism. He dissolved parliament and banned opposition parties in 1913 and 1914. These actions consolidated his power but also drew criticism from those who had hoped for a more democratic system.</p><p>In 1915, Yuan attempted to revive the monarchy with himself as emperor. He ordered expensive imperial robes and a large set of porcelain in preparation for his coronation. This move faced widespread opposition from various groups across China, however, and Yuan was ultimately forced to abandon his imperial ambitions in 1916.</p><p>He died shortly after this failed bid for the throne. His death left a power vacuum that contributed to a period of political fragmentation in China known as the Warlord Era.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>September 16</a>, <a href=#>1859</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Xiangcheng, Henan, Qing dynasty, China<br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Virgo</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>June 6</a>, <a href=#>1916</a> (aged 56)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> Uremia (<a href=#>kidney failure</a>)</p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Military Career</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1913-03-22</a> Song Jiaoren, leader of the Chinese Kuomintang Party, shot at Shanghai Railway Station, dies 2 day later (thought orchestrated by Kuomintang President Yuan Shikai)</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1913-04-26</a> Sun Yet San calls for revolt against President Yuan Shikai in China</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1913-09-01</a> Zhang Xun's Wuwei Corps captures Nanjing on behalf of Emperor Yuan Shikai in the Republic of China's Second Revolution, ending Chinese independence and causing Sun Yat Sen to flee to Japan</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1913-10-10</a> Yuan Shikai installed as the 1st President of China</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1914-05-01</a> Yuan Shikai's cabinet replaces China's provisional constitution with a constitutional compact granting the President dictatorial powers over China's military, finances, foreign policy, and the rights of Chinese citizens</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1916-06-06</a> The death of Yuan Shikai, ruler of much of China since 1912, causes central government to virtually collapse in the face of pressure from warlords, and from political reformers including <a href=#>Sun Yat-Sen</a></li></ul><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwxdSapWarmJ64orU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-greatest-showman-stage-musical-in-development-disney-1236102495.html><span>←</span><span>The Greatest Showman Stage Musical in Development at Disney</span></a>
