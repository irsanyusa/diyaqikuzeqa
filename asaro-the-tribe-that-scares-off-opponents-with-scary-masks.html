The Asaro tribe was said to have adapted this new mode of dressing whenever they were attacked by an enemy tribe and over the years, they improvised by adding long fingers made with bamboo to have the overall ghostly effect.</p><p>While the Asaro tribe might no longer be fighting wars, they still use their scary masks and some people say they use it to scare off spirits. The masks always come with unusual designs but they all look quite scary. Some are made with long or very short ears, horns and sideways mouths.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cK3SmqmoZaSdsm7A0aKZnmWkna61edKcmKudo2K8p7KMqKepp56au7W%2FjLCgraBdqLCivthmpJqrm6h8rbfBnKipbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./data-deep-dive-into-luxury-consumers.html><span>←</span><span>A Data Deep Dive Into Luxury Consumers</span></a>
