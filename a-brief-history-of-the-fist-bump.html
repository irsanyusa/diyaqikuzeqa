The origins of the bump are murky, though most communication experts agree on a basic — if fuzzy — evolutionary timeline: the handshake (which itself dates back to ancient times) begat the “gimme-five” palm slap that later evolved into the now universal “high-five” and, finally, the fist bump."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But on Tuesday night, millions of people <a href=# rel=noopener>witnessed</a> Michelle Obama daintily knocking knuckles with her husband as the Illinois Senator took the stage to claim the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. The Washington <i>Post</i> called it <a href=# rel=noopener>“the fist bump heard ’round the world.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The origins of the bump are murky, though most communication experts agree on a basic — if fuzzy — evolutionary timeline: the handshake (which itself dates back to ancient times) begat the “gimme-five” palm slap that later evolved into the now universal “high-five” and, finally, the fist bump.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some claim the act of <a href=# rel=noopener>knuckle-bumping</a> began in the 1970s with NBA players like Baltimore Bullets guard Fred Carter. Others claim the fist bump’s national debut occurred off the court, citing the <a href=# rel=noopener>Wonder Twins</a>, minor characters in the 1970s Hanna-Barbera superhero cartoon <i>The Superfriends</i>, who famously touched knuckles and cried “Wonder Twin powers, activate!’ before morphing into animals or ice sculptures. One might also credit germaphobics for the fist bump’s popularity. <i>Deal or No Deal</i> host Howie Mandel reportedly adopted the gesture as a friendly way to avoid his contestants’ germs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even the terminology used to describe the manual move is under dispute. On reporting Obama’s speech, The New York <i>Times</i> described it stuffily as a <a href=# rel=noopener>“closed-fisted high-five”</a> while <i>Human Events</i> reader racily suggested it was closer to <a href=# rel=noopener>“Hezbollah-style fist-jabbing,”</a> (the comment was later removed from the article). One Internet poster even referred to it as “the fist bump of hope.” Other terms for the move include “power five,” “fist pound,” “knuckle bump,” “Quarter Pounder” and “dap.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The fist bump’s precursor, the low- and high-fives, originated in the 1950s, again mostly among athletes, who deemed handshakes too muted and formal for celebrating teamwork and triumph. The 1980s are generally regarded as the heyday of the high-five, though the gesture has enjoyed a revival of sorts in recent years — especially among Gen-X parents and their offspring. Modern-day high-five enthusiasts have even created a cellphone version: Callers high-five their phones (slap the speakers) or simultaneously type “5.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The problem with the high-five is that it can occasionally be hard to pull off. Just ask Tiger Woods and his caddie, who <a href=# rel=noopener>botched</a> a high-five on national TV during the 2005 U.S. Masters Golf Tournament. Perhaps this is what makes the fist bump so unique. Though simple in motion, its meaning is far more complicated. In any other context, a clenched fist would be perceived as hostile.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ambiguities aside, most pundits and observers alike had complimentary words for the Obama family’s fist bump, seeing it as a rare moment of spontaneity and playfulness that a race already in its 17th month sorely needed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Gestures, particularly ones that are recent, haven’t been studied that much,” says David Givens, director of the Center for Nonverbal Studies in Spokane, Wash. “For me, it’s ironic because we all noticed that fist bump. I thought it was very touching. It was an elegant little non-verbal moment and it gave us a view into their relationship.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For his part, Obama, who once <a href=# rel=noopener>likened</a> himself to NBA star LeBron James, said the fist bump reflects a marriage that keeps him grounded. “It captures what I love about my wife,” he later explained to NBC’s Brian Williams. “That for all the hoopla I’m her husband and sometimes we’ll do silly things.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though <a href=# rel=noopener>National High-Five Day</a> already exists — the third Thursday in April every year — the fist bump has yet to claim its own day on the calendar. June 3rd might be a good candidate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9wamtgZX5wrYybqaKdlmK1qr%2FTqKmyZZ%2BberW0xGadoqukYq%2B2uc9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./une-proposition-de-loi-pour-proteger-les-numeros-des-departements.html><span>←</span><span>Une proposition de loi pour protger les numros des dpartements</span></a>
