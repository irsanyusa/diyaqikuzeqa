To do that effectively, you need to understand who YOU are. What are your values, your dreams, your dealbreakers?

Do we share similar values and life goals?</h3></p><p>In marriage, you both need to be headed in the same general direction. Do you agree on the importance of family, finances, or religion?

Can I handle conflict in a healthy way?</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Arguments are a normal part of life, even in the happiest marriages. The key is how you handle them. Can you both communicate calmly and respectfully, even when you disagree? Are you willing to compromise and work towards solutions together? Healthy conflict resolution is essential for a long-lasting relationship.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>6.
