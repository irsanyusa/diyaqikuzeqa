News in 2006. The single mother said she endured the unwanted, sexually aggressive touching, groping and attention for fear of losing her job. In 2013, when Hardy reported the alleged workplace abuse to her company’s human resources department, she says she was fired.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Seacrest, who co-hosts ABC’s talk show Live with Kelly & Ryan and produces Keeping Up with the Kardashians, was the first to make the sexual misconduct accusations public when he <a href=# rel=noopener>issued a vigorous denial</a> last November.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Recently, someone that worked as a wardrobe stylist for me nearly a decade ago at E! News, came forward with a complaint suggesting I behaved inappropriately toward her. If I made her feel anything but respected, I am truly sorry. I dispute these reckless allegations and I plan to cooperate with any corporate inquiries that may result,” Seacrest said <a href=# rel=noopener>in his statement</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">E! announced in January that its investigation into the sexual misconduct claims against Seacrest had concluded with “insufficient” evidence of wrongdoing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hardy told Variety that she was opting to speak out for the first time about the allegations because she felt “total exasperation” after her complaint was dismissed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It was obvious the investigator was whitewashing it for Seacrest’s side,” she claimed, adding that the investigator never contacted four witnesses who she claimed would corroborate her story.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Seacrest’s lawyer, Adam Baum, told PEOPLE in a statement that “<a href=# rel=noopener>it is upsetting</a>” that Variety chose to run Hardy’s “untrue allegations”.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“They were told that the accuser threatened to make those false claims against him unless he paid her $15 million,” Baum said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An E! spokesperson told Variety that questioning the legitimacy of its investigation is “completely baseless.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaWdsfXaDjqyrsqSZqMFuvtiapWarlZaws7HSrWSsnaiqrq15zKKqnKeemcKkwI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quasiment-assimiles-des-salaries-les-maires-europeens-ont-des-remunerations-variables.html><span>←</span><span>Quasiment assimils des salaris, les maires europens ont des rmunrations variables</span></a>
