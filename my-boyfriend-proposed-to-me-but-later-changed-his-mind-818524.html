One of&nbsp;our readers was on&nbsp;cloud nine after her boyfriend proposed. However, everything came crashing back down to&nbsp;earth the very next day. Now she’s caught in&nbsp;this mix of&nbsp;love, hurt, and confusion, wondering how in&nbsp;the world she ended up&nbsp;on&nbsp;this <a href=# title=emotional data-link=tag>emotional</a> rollercoaster.</p><p><h2>Our reader dropped&nbsp;us a&nbsp;message.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e69/216/60e8625d96b1516c0998eb3213.jpg><p>Nothing has changed. The fact that he was laughing with his ex is neither here nor there!</p><p>Thanks for getting in&nbsp;touch! We’re really sorry about what happened, but don’t worry, we’re here to&nbsp;help you through&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Reconsider your relationship.</h2></p><p>Ask yourself if&nbsp;your <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> is&nbsp;actually what you want. Decide if&nbsp;he’s the man you want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;married&nbsp;to. It&nbsp;seems like your boyfriend has already done some thinking, so&nbsp;feel free to&nbsp;rethink your relationship as&nbsp;well. Remember that you deserve to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship that brings you happiness, love, and mutual respect. Don’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>settle</a> for anything less than you deserve.</p><p><h2>Talk to&nbsp;him and ask questions.</h2></p><p>Don’t hold back&nbsp;— have a&nbsp;chat with your boyfriend and get straight to&nbsp;the point. Ask him about his chat with his ex&nbsp;and why he’s having doubts about getting married. Make it&nbsp;clear that you need honest answers to&nbsp;understand where things stand. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>refuses</a> to&nbsp;talk things out, you might have to&nbsp;think about what’s best for you.</p><p><h2>Don’t bottle up&nbsp;your emotions.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you’re feeling hurt, confused, or&nbsp;disappointed by&nbsp;what he’s done, don’t keep it&nbsp;to&nbsp;yourself. Talk to&nbsp;him about how his actions are affecting you. Be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>honest</a> about how much his sudden change of&nbsp;plans and seeing him with his ex&nbsp;has messed with your emotions. Opening up&nbsp;about your feelings might make it&nbsp;easier for both of&nbsp;you to&nbsp;work through this together.</p><p><h2>See if&nbsp;there are some hidden issues.</h2></p><p>Strangely, he&nbsp;changed his mind so&nbsp;suddenly, so&nbsp;take a&nbsp;step back and see if&nbsp;there are any hidden <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>issues</a> in&nbsp;the relationship that you haven’t addressed. Sometimes, problems can build up&nbsp;over time and lead to&nbsp;situations like this. Consider all parts of&nbsp;your relationship to&nbsp;figure out what’s happening.</p><p>Most of&nbsp;us know the saying, «opposites attract,» but sometimes, it’s not exactly true. In&nbsp;<a href=#>this story</a>, our reader who isn’t into sports noticed that her husband made friends with a&nbsp;woman who loves sports as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;he&nbsp;does. Now, she’s wondering if&nbsp;there’s something more going&nbsp;on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXnPq6app6OasW7AzmaknmWSqsFuuMCtnKtlk52ur7PEnWShoaNiuqq6w2ZvanBlZ4Fw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./les-quinze-chantiers-des-centres-de-gestion.html><span>←</span><span>Les quinze chantiers des centres de gestion</span></a>
