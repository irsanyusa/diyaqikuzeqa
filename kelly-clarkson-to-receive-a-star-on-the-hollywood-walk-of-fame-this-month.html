This month marks the 20th anniversary of her American Idol win, so this achievement very fitting for the winner.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Clarkson Celebrates Multiple Career Milestones</h2><p>Kelly Clarkson is officially set to receive her star on the Hollywood walk of fame. For those who may not know, she was originally set to receive this honor in 2021, but the ceremony was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since this singer recently celebrated the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">20th anniversary</a> of her American Idol win, the timing could not be any more perfect.</p><p>Throughout Clarkson’s 20 years in the industry, she has released nine studio albums in total. To celebrate the accomplishment, the singer has taken a look back at her career.</p><p>“It’s crazy!” Clarkson said while reminiscing her 20 years of work. “But it feels like 40. That was a lifetime ago.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Clarkson’s debut single, “A Moment Like This,” ranks as the year’s best-selling single in the U.S. in 2002. She is the recipient of an array of awards, including a Daytime Emmy Award in 2022 for “Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host” for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>.</p><p>This September has already been quite eventful for the 40-year-old singer. Along with getting the Hollywood Walk of Fame star, she has also celebrated 20 years since her win in the inaugural season of American Idol.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-will-present-the-star-to-clarkson>Simon Cowell Will Present the Star to Clarkson</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a> received his own Hollywood Walk of Fame star from Clarkson back in 2018. He plans to return the favor this year by honoring Clarkson with her very own star on September 19. American Idol fans are happy to see Cowell presenting Clarkson with her place on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>This achievement for Clarkson is a very momentous career milestone for the singer. Even Cowell himself is just as excited as anyone, speaking about the honor of working with Clarkson again. We can’t help but wait for them to get back to work and be amazed by the honor that suits Clarkson perfectly.</p><p>Cowell firmly believes that Clarkson would have been famous even without appearing on American Idol. To this day, Cowell believes that most of the show’s success was due to Clarkson’s talent and overall popularity. Cowell also praises Clarkson’s humor, personality, and charisma among her other defining aspects. To see Clarkson receive her star, watch the Hollywood Walk of Fame Livestream on September 19.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/TaylorWilliamson_AikoTanaka.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Alumni Aiko Tanaka, Taylor Williamson to Appear in Upcoming Comedy Show" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdlpKR6s7HCnqCvnV2WerTAwKtkqKZdqbWmeceoo6Wxp6S8pXnWmqOkZZ%2BbeqetzJ5kraCZqHquu82tn2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-makes-a-rare-appearance-in-a-video-and-people-spot-an-odd-detail-819906.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton Makes a Rare Appearance in a Video and People Spot an Odd Detail</span></a>
