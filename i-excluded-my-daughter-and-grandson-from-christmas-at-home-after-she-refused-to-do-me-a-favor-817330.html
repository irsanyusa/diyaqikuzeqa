My&nbsp;oldest, age&nbsp;25, is&nbsp;from a&nbsp;previous relationship in&nbsp;<a href=# title="high school" data-link=tag>high school</a>. After a&nbsp;separation, I&nbsp;later married my&nbsp;husband. My&nbsp;younger&nbsp;2, ages 9&nbsp;and&nbsp;7, still believe in&nbsp;Santa, while my&nbsp;daughter’s son, who doesn’t share the same belief, was raised without the magic of&nbsp;Santa. I&nbsp;<a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> her choice, but&nbsp;I prefer not to&nbsp;spoil the Santa belief for my&nbsp;younger children who still embrace&nbsp;it.</p><p>I&nbsp;hosted Christmas at&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>house</a> and asked my&nbsp;daughter to&nbsp;speak with her son about not revealing the truth about Santa, as&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;preserve the magic for my&nbsp;younger children. We&nbsp;still have presents labeled “from Santa” and leave out cookies and birdseed as&nbsp;reindeer treats. However, my&nbsp;daughter refused to&nbsp;ask her son to&nbsp;keep up&nbsp;the pretense, asserting that my&nbsp;children were old enough to&nbsp;understand if&nbsp;he&nbsp;disclosed anything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/420/e8d/78418e5a23aa62b8ce2836ed73.jpg><p>When I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suggested</a> that if&nbsp;she didn’t talk to&nbsp;her son, they could celebrate Christmas at&nbsp;their own apartment, my&nbsp;daughter felt hurt. She accused me&nbsp;of&nbsp;prioritizing my&nbsp;younger children’s <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a> over hers and being unreasonable. While my&nbsp;husband supports&nbsp;me, he&nbsp;thinks&nbsp;I might be&nbsp;overreacting since our children are growing&nbsp;up. My&nbsp;intention is&nbsp;simply to&nbsp;maintain the wonder of&nbsp;Christmas for as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;possible.</p><p><h2>Opinions are divided.</h2></p><p>Some people believed the woman shouldn’t have cut her eldest daughter over her kids’ beliefs:</p><ul><li>Christmas magic includes asking a&nbsp;5-year-old to&nbsp;lie, and if&nbsp;he&nbsp;doesn’t, he&nbsp;and his mother will be&nbsp;isolated for the holiday, maybe estranging yourself from your daughter? <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>jennajooniper&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Could you explain to&nbsp;your children that not everyone believes in&nbsp;Santa, and that’s okay? I&nbsp;empathize with wanting to&nbsp;give your children the happiest holiday memories and feeling unhappy when wrenches get thrown into those plans, but it&nbsp;seems like there should be&nbsp;creative solutions here that don’t make other members of&nbsp;your <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> feel unwelcome. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ChupaChupnana&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>You need to&nbsp;keep the Christmas magic alive by&nbsp;your definition, but that does not negate that another part of&nbsp;Christmas magic is&nbsp;about family. Your willingness to&nbsp;shun your daughter and grandchild over Santa speaks volumes about you and what you think is&nbsp;important in&nbsp;life. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>CrocanoirZA&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4cd/1c2/d2370a51d5a12cab519eeeef8b.jpg><p>Some, however, understood the woman didn’t want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something wrong:</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;worked with a&nbsp;woman who raised her kids with no&nbsp;Santa. She knew that other kids did believe and she prepared for&nbsp;it. Her kids were taught that everyone has different things they believe in&nbsp;and that everyone should be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;just that. They were never to&nbsp;say anything about “no&nbsp;Santa” to&nbsp;another child. Other kids believing in&nbsp;Santa was okay. Your daughter chose to&nbsp;raise her son with her beliefs, she needs to&nbsp;allow others to&nbsp;raise their children with their own beliefs. It’s not lying to&nbsp;say nothing and let others believe. It’s not lying to&nbsp;simply say nothing. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bflamingo63&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;would want to&nbsp;keep my&nbsp;children’s belief in&nbsp;Santa alive, especially at&nbsp;those ages...and it&nbsp;sounds kind of&nbsp;like your daughter is&nbsp;almost encouraging bursting the bubble. Nothing wrong with having a&nbsp;discussion with her kid like you would with an&nbsp;older child who finds out&nbsp;— not to&nbsp;ruin the fun for others. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kelsoste&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Christmas magic is&nbsp;awesome! I&nbsp;love the ability to&nbsp;believe that children have Santa Claus, fairies, the Easter Bunny, etc., it’s all in&nbsp;good fun. I&nbsp;wish&nbsp;I could go&nbsp;back and believe that these mythical magical beings existed. People are delirious if&nbsp;they pretend that their parents telling them Santa exists was the biggest betrayal they have ever experienced. Ridiculous. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Street_Passage_1151&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Choosing the perfect Christmas gift for a&nbsp;loved one can be&nbsp;challenging, but it’s the sentiment that counts. However, one <a href=#>woman</a> found herself unable to&nbsp;please her daughter-in-law despite several attempts. After numerous failed efforts, the mother-in-law decided she had had enough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZusdeco66clZl6rsWMnZiun5ipsrN5wKebZp%2Bilrulv86nZJ%2Bqn6J6pLTRoqqtpZGoeqLAjKGmpp1dlrO1sdFmqqGdXaeyp8HSnptmrJ9isbB5zJ5kmmWWlsOwvoxxaHBrY2V8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-coco-rocha-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Coco Rocha Make?
