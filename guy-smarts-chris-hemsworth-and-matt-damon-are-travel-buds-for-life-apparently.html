Welcome to This Week in Chrises.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-3>Chris Hemsworth: Took&nbsp;another vacation&nbsp;with pal Matt Damon</h3></p><p>They say it's&nbsp;important to travel with your significant other&nbsp;- but what about your best bud?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Chris Hemsworth, Matt Damon, and their families - minus Hemsworth's wife,&nbsp;Elsa Pataky&nbsp;- spent some quality time frolicking in the sun at Queensland's North Stradbroke Island this week, according to the&nbsp;Daily Mail.</p><p>Of course, Hemsworth hit the water with the kids upon arrival, donning a shorty wetsuit and grabbing his surfboard along the way. For inspiration on how to get a six-pack like Hemsworth's, here are&nbsp;10 ways to work out like the Australian actor.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>Chris Evans: Campaigned for his uncle’s re-election bid in Boston</h3></p><p>We gotta say, getting Captain America to endorse your reelection campaign is pretty clutch.</p><p>Congressman Michael Capuano is hard at work on the campaign trail in Boston for his re-election campaign - and this week, his nephew Chris Evans stepped in to help him out.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"My Uncle Mike is a fighter - fighting for healthcare, for education, for human rights, and to make lives better. Proud to support him the other night as we work to reelect@mikecapuano," Evans tweeted.</p><p>"Thank you to my family, including my nephew&nbsp;@chrisevans, for your support," Capuano tweeted. "Together, we'll keep fighting to create more opportunities for everyone, and I won't stop until the playing field is level for all.&nbsp;#TeamCap."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>Chris Pratt: Wants Marvel fans to know that everyone makes mistakes</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>If you've seen&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War, you know that Chris Pratt's character, Star-Lord, kinda f***s things up big time - you know, hitting Thanos in the face and letting him go on to extinguish half of all life in the galaxy. (If you want to read more about the aforementioned f***-up,&nbsp;click here.)</p><p>But guess what? Pratt DGAF about what you think about his character's controversial move!</p><p>"I think if we did it a hundred times, I wouldn’t change a thing," he&nbsp;told&nbsp;Radio Times&nbsp;earlier this week.</p><p>"Look, the guy watched his mother die, he watched as his father-figure died in his arms, he was forced to kill his own biological father," Pratt added. "And now has suffered the loss of the love of his life. So I think he reacted in a way that’s very human, and I think the humanity of the Guardians of the Galaxy is what sets them apart from other superheroes."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>Chris Pine: Has an ex-flame going on a reality show</h3></p><p>Chris Pine is about to be in quite the pickle: One of his alleged ex-flames is starring in a new reality TV show,&nbsp;Love Island, and she's already spilling details of their extremely short-lived romance to the press.</p><p>Love Island&nbsp;contestant Samira Mighty told&nbsp;Radio Times&nbsp;that she and Pine went on one date after meeting at the&nbsp;GQ&nbsp;Men of the Year after-party in 2016. Mighty says she saw Pine and thought, "My God, he was in that movie with Lindsay Lohan [the 2006 film&nbsp;Just My Luck]."</p><p>If that’s the one film you can think of with Pine in it… OK.</p><p>"He kind of moved to me and I thought, 'He seems fun, he seems cool,'" she said. "I kind of looked him up and thought, 'He’s actually a pretty big deal.' He was like, 'Take my number.'"</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Mighty said the pair met up at SoHo House in London, but things ended quickly because Mighty was still getting over a past breakup. "We’re only friends," she said. "I was too heartbroken and I thought, 'I can’t deal with this.'"</p><p>Pine, who's&nbsp;reportedly dating actress Annabelle Wallis, hasn't publicly acknowledged Mighty's story. If it's all true, it's too bad for Mighty that things didn't work out: Pine is arguably the coolest, classiest, best-dressed Chris of all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cLPUsmSspZGnwbR5wqGpoqtdnbKuv9aoqa2gXZa7pXnMmqutZZSWurC6jJqpnmWkp663sctmma6co2KzsL6MpaCfnV2WvbGt0Z6lraSpZLmvwMmxaGk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./18-animals-who-look-exactly-like-celebrities-690810.html><span>←</span><span>18Animals Who Look Exactly Like Celebrities</span></a>
