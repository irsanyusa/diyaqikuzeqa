Hovington, an educator and a school librarian, was there with her partner, her daughter and her other two children. “There were a lot of tears shed in the hotel that we’re at.

After news struck yesterday that the terrorist attack was thwarted and local promoter Barracuda Music canceled the performances, the streets of Vienna became something of a vigil for the Swifties who came together to mourn the loss — not just of the shows, but also the time and money spent to get there.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My friend is in Vienna and sent me this video of swifties coming together this morning and I’m fully sobbing 😭🫶🏻 <a href=# rel=nofollow>@taylornation13</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>@taylorswift13</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#WeLoveYouTaylor</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#ViennaTStheErasTour</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/B4ZAXy5AvD</a></p>— elizabeth 🪩 (student at ttpd) (@cateyeswift13) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 8, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">But the cancellations also had an unexpected effect, unifying those Swifties in a time of danger and uncertainty. Fans filled the streets in photos and videos posted on social media, and local churches and business came out in support of the Vienna Swifties.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On social media, attendees documented chalk drawings on the pavement outside of the stadium where Swift was slated to perform that referenced Swift lyrics: “Fuck the patriarchy (and terrorists),” “This is why we can’t have nice things.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In front of the stadium 🫶🏻💔 <a href=# rel=nofollow>#ViennaTStheErasTour</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/SCnhFxkFX0</a></p>— Alina 🤍🔜 eras vienna (@alinalovestay) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 8, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Photos and videos showed fans congregating on Vienna’s Corneliusgasse due to its similarity to “Cornelia Street,” Swift’s song that was included on 2019’s “Lover.” Throngs of people rallied together to sing “Cruel Summer,” an ironic nod to their current situation. One couple even got engaged on the streets while the crowd belted out “Love Story.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“This [is] happening right now in Cornelia Street,” wrote one on <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://x.com/gossipverse/status/1821503930972377122 rel=nofollow>X</a>. “We create our own safe spaces you stupid spider boys can’t destroy.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Local establishments came out in support of Swifties. “My daughter heard a Taylor Swift song playing in the street, and she just stopped,” says Hovington. “There was this sign outside of this building. We didn’t realize it was a church, but there was a sign that said, ‘Dear Swifties, we sympathize with you. You’re welcome to come and sing your sadness away.'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>thank you lovely church in <a href=# rel=nofollow>#vienna</a> that played Taylor swift songs the day of the first cancelled concert and gave lots of sad swifties a place to gather.

But the Swifties are very resilient, and people just got on about their day and were kind and swapping friendship bracelets and singing songs anyway.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Another attendee, Josie Martin, shared her own experience with Variety about her trip to Vienna. A 28-year-old elementary school teacher from Grand Rapids, Mich., she made plans over a year ago to attend the concert with her family. Her brother, who lives in Madagascar, miraculously secured a VIP ticket code off of Reddit last year, and they coordinated a European family vacation, complete with a stop at the Eras Tour.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After hearing news of the cancellations while in Vienna, she and her family found fans singing together in the streets. “Walking around was kind of adorable,” she says. “I’m an elementary teacher, so it was kind of adorable seeing all these young girls, but then also the juxtaposition of their parents figuring out accommodations is so sad. They’re trying to pivot and be positive and take them around town. They’re all exchanging bracelets on the street, which is adorable. When we heard all the singing, my mom was like, ‘Do you think people are protesting?’ I was like, ‘No, they’re literally singing “You Belong With Me.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Despite the canceled concert and thwarted terrorist plot, people were “trying to stay positive.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“When we were walking around St. Stephen’s Cathedral, there were people in their outfits. Like, you know they picked that out for tonight because they’re wearing poofy, sparkly dresses. This is their one outfit they probably brought, or they just wanted to wear it so they could wear it. That was cute but kind of sad.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With a potential tragedy prevented, Swifties showed out and proved their loyalty – not only to Swift, but to each other. The hashtag <a href=# rel=nofollow>#ViennaTStheErasTour</a> continues to trend across social media apps with spectators from all over the globe chiming in with words of encouragement for the disappointed fans.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We may not have gotten to hear ‘August’ live in August like we thought, but we still got to sing it together,” one fan wrote on X. “This healed something in me. Swifties are so beautiful. I will never forget this.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>we may not have gotten to hear August live IN August like we
