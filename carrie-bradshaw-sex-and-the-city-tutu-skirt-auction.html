The Sex and the City heroine was a sex columnist with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an affinity for emotionally unavailable finance guys</a>, but the true way to her heart could be found in her closet: so much so that, she once confessed, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she could not buy her apartment because she had 100 pairs of Manolo Blahnik shoes</a>. And though Carrie had plenty of show-stopping looks during the six seasons that the show was on the air, there was none more iconic that the look that started it all—the white tutu skirt she wore with a pink leotard during the opening credits of the show.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The whimsical yet sexy look was the brainchild of legendary costume designer Patricia Field, who <a href=#>wrote in her 2023 memoir</a>, Pat in the City: My Life of Fashion, Style, and Breaking All the Rules, that she got the skirt for the bargain price of $5, fishing it out of "five-dollar bin at a midtown fashion showroom."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I pulled and out came a sort of chic white tutu," Field wrote. "I imagined pairing the short, tiered tulle skirt with a small tee or tank for a look that was both contemporary and cool…the tutu-style skirt was whimsical, adventurous, and unexpected—kind of like this show, ‘Sex and the City.'”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#>A True New Yorker Would Never Give Up Carrie Bradshaw’s Apartment</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though the tutu had humble beginnings, it went up on the auction block with Julien’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Unstoppable: Signature Styles of Iconic Women in Fashion”</a> auction, which took place on Jan. 18 and included dresses that were worn by the likes of Audrey Hepburn and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Diana</a>. Bidding began at $2,000, with Julien's estimating that it would sell for as much as $12,000. In the end, the dress sold for $52,000, more than six times its estimate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The famed tutu, which Field said she selected because of Sarah Jessica Parker's background as a ballet dancer and because Carrie had "princess syndrome," was initially vetoed by showrunner Darren Star, who favored a more chic look for Carrie in the credits. Field, however, presciently reasoned that if the show became a hit, then something trendy would look dated in re-runs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I knew anything less would be dated by next season," she wrote in her memoir. "People want to see what they haven’t seen before – not some trendy shift dress from Fall 199-whatever. From the opening credits to every single scene of the series, however long it might last, my overriding aim would be to make sure that while the clothes were expressive and helping to tell the story, they were never burnt with exposure."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbWVofneEjpyYq6qZmnqjvsCdqqGZp2LApsSMmqWdZaSdsm6vyK2wZqylqcJuv8qiqa1lkaqwtbXOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./action-logement-va-construire-80000-logements-intermediaires-en-ile-de-france-dici-2025.html><span>←</span><span>Action logement va construire 80.000 logements intermdiaires en Ile-de-France d'ici 2025</span></a>
