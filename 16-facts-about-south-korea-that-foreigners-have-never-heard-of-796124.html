This includes beauty standards, how children are raised, and college educations.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> dove into the Korean lifestyle and found curious habits, rules, and traditions and decided to&nbsp;tell you about them.</p><p><h2>1. Korean women sit with blankets on&nbsp;their knees.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf5/5cc/433e845e1aad50199974b9626f.jpg><p>Generally, there are 3&nbsp;main <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reasons</a> Korean women put blankets on&nbsp;their knees. K-pop idols, TV&nbsp;show guests, and regular people use them in&nbsp;cafes, restaurants, and other public places. First, they are uncomfortable sitting down in&nbsp;short skirts or&nbsp;dresses when they’re on&nbsp;stage. The cameramen also film them at&nbsp;different angles, so&nbsp;it’s risky for them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;over-exposed at&nbsp;any angle. Second, it’s simply their culture and part of&nbsp;the norm&nbsp;— covering legs with a&nbsp;blanket or&nbsp;veil while sitting down is&nbsp;considered respectful in&nbsp;Korea. They are showing respect to&nbsp;their audience that’s watching. And lastly, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;quite cold in&nbsp;the studio, especially if&nbsp;they are standing or&nbsp;sitting still. The environment in&nbsp;the studio is&nbsp;kept cool because these women often dance and move around a&nbsp;lot. That’s why they have another reason to&nbsp;keep blankets&nbsp;on, to&nbsp;keep them warm.</p><p>They do&nbsp;it&nbsp;so&nbsp;that they don’t reveal anything when wearing a&nbsp;mini skirt and also protect their private space because a&nbsp;blanket is&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;modesty.</p><p><h2>2. Women cover their mouths when laughing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/127/c7f/43f2db557ab9be623b3206a9ca.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>laughing</a> publicly is&nbsp;a&nbsp;breach of&nbsp;etiquette. When something makes them laugh, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, they look away or&nbsp;try to&nbsp;conceal their smiles. And this is&nbsp;done even with one’s own spouse. If&nbsp;you see a&nbsp;Korean woman covering her mouth, she is&nbsp;probably laughing and not yawning.</p><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;their culture to&nbsp;cover their mouth when they smile or&nbsp;laugh, and it’s mostly done by&nbsp;Korean women. When they are shocked, embarrassed, grieving, or&nbsp;scared, they tend to&nbsp;cover their face with their hands. If&nbsp;they see something embarrassing, they likely turn their heads to&nbsp;not show they are engaged in&nbsp;the scene. For instance, if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple kissing in&nbsp;public, they won’t look at&nbsp;them so&nbsp;the couple doesn’t feel embarrassed. Not only that, but there are other interesting facts when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;weddings. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;bride smiles during&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;may mean she’ll have difficulties for the rest of&nbsp;her life.</p><p><h2>3. V- and S-lines are valued in&nbsp;women’s bodies</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b8a/e94/15da505c90ab58a959b957aa7b.jpg><p>A&nbsp;V-line is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pointy chin</a>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the best for both girls and guys because it&nbsp;makes them look more elegant. Being told that you have a&nbsp;pointy chin is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;compliment in&nbsp;Korea, even if&nbsp;you are a&nbsp;foreigner. A&nbsp;V-shape is&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;small, oval shape with a&nbsp;sharp chin, and it’s viewed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;desirable feature. It&nbsp;also symbolizes femininity and being delicate as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the cultural norm. It&nbsp;can make you younger and more innocent as&nbsp;well.</p><p>An&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>S-line</a> is&nbsp;the outline of&nbsp;the female body, a&nbsp;more slender version of&nbsp;the hourglass body shape. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;Korean man says that you have beautiful&nbsp;V and S-lines, it&nbsp;means he&nbsp;likes your chin and your body. To&nbsp;get that crazy S-line, Korean women will reduce their sodium intake and usually follow the Keto diet. Sometimes they’ll even do&nbsp;intermittent fasting (timing their meals).</p><p><h2>4. All drivers have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;alcohol tests.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4cb/52c/babd28583a841141abc0f9981c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the evening, often on&nbsp;Fridays and Saturdays, Korean policemen block one side of&nbsp;the road and check all the drivers. When you see a&nbsp;patrol car, you have to&nbsp;pull over, open the window, and take an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>alcohol test</a>. People who drive under the influence can face up&nbsp;to&nbsp;3&nbsp;years behind bars or&nbsp;even life imprisonment.</p><p><h2>5. You don’t have to&nbsp;stay inside during the rainy season.</h2></p><p></p><p>This may be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the more interesting facts about Korea. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>monsoon</a> season in&nbsp;Korea starts in&nbsp;June and ends in&nbsp;mid-July. Sometimes there are floods during this period, but cars still drive and people walk knee-deep in&nbsp;water under an&nbsp;umbrella. In&nbsp;Korea, the winters are usually cold and dry, and summers are hot and wet. But visiting Korea during the rainy season isn’t advisable since it&nbsp;is&nbsp;constantly raining. It&nbsp;may be&nbsp;best to&nbsp;visit during the spring or&nbsp;fall, and if&nbsp;you don’t mind the cold, you can visit in&nbsp;the winter as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>6. They have very good food in&nbsp;their hospitals.</h2></p><p>Every day, in&nbsp;regular Korean <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hospitals</a>, they serve different foods, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clam soups</a> are accompanied by&nbsp;traditional appetizers, such as&nbsp;rice and kimchi. Korean soups are one of&nbsp;the main dishes in&nbsp;both North and South Korea. They are generally served with every meal because it&nbsp;doesn’t require many ingredients and is&nbsp;quite easy to&nbsp;make. There are also many types of&nbsp;soups.</p><p><h2>7. They sell K-pop idols instead of&nbsp;Barbie dolls</h2></p><p>K-pop singers are so&nbsp;popular you can buy a&nbsp;small replica of&nbsp;them in&nbsp;any store. Above you can see the members of&nbsp;the band <a href=#>BTS</a>.</p><p><h2>8. Thrifty tourists can stay in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sauna</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fb/29f/d7ed2657888dd9bf1b0acdbbf8.jpg><p>Korean public baths or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saunas</a> are called <i>jjimjilbang</i>. Tourists who come to&nbsp;the country for a&nbsp;short period of&nbsp;time try to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the saunas and the locals come here to&nbsp;restore their energy after work or&nbsp;after a&nbsp;big party. At&nbsp;the entrance, they put on&nbsp;yangmeori, or&nbsp;sheep’s head, which are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>towels that you put on&nbsp;your head</a>. Inside, there are also couches and playrooms for children.</p><p><h2>9. Koreans don’t talk to&nbsp;the opposite sex if&nbsp;they are in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5da/d1f/581cbd54a59b16e85784060ff7.jpg><p>In&nbsp;South Korea, most people don’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believe</a> that men and women can be&nbsp;friends. So&nbsp;when a&nbsp;guy and a&nbsp;girl start a&nbsp;relationship, they can no&nbsp;longer see their friends of&nbsp;the opposite sex.</p><p>Everywhere else in&nbsp;the world, people want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;accepted for who they are when in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship, which is&nbsp;why 2&nbsp;people who are friends for a&nbsp;long time can develop feelings for each other. But in&nbsp;Korea, when you become friends with the opposite sex during childhood, it&nbsp;tends to&nbsp;fade away as&nbsp;you grow older and get married. They don’t want their lifetime friends to&nbsp;develop feelings toward them. Generally, in&nbsp;Korea, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that the 2&nbsp;genders are not supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;friends, and they can’t be&nbsp;if&nbsp;they’re meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together.</p><p><h2>10. They celebrate the day of&nbsp;love on&nbsp;November&nbsp;11.</h2></p><p>The holiday is&nbsp;called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Pepero Day</a>&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was named after sweet breadsticks with different icing&nbsp;— and they celebrate it&nbsp;on&nbsp;11/11. These gifts can not only be&nbsp;given to&nbsp;loved ones, but also to&nbsp;friends and relatives. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;still unknown the real origins of&nbsp;Pepero Day: some say it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;schoolgirl trend on&nbsp;the ’80s, while others believe that the holiday was made up&nbsp;by&nbsp;Lotte, which produces these sticks.</p><p><h2>11. Koreans love to&nbsp;keep their hands warm.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4a/19f/0b44de5aa79cc04f69437a7056.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Korean hairdresser, a&nbsp;beauty salon, or&nbsp;some other place, you will probably be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>offered</a> a&nbsp;hand warmer, even if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good heating system in&nbsp;the building.</p><p>A&nbsp;hot pack is&nbsp;a&nbsp;small warm pack that can stay <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>warm</a> for a&nbsp;hours, and it’s very popular in&nbsp;their culture. It&nbsp;can come in&nbsp;many sizes and vary in&nbsp;how long they stay warm. There are some hot packs that can be&nbsp;small enough to&nbsp;carry in&nbsp;pockets or&nbsp;shoes, and the bigger ones can last for a&nbsp;longer time. It’s important to&nbsp;know that they can be&nbsp;very hot, so&nbsp;it’s advisable to&nbsp;be&nbsp;careful before applying them directly to&nbsp;your skin. To&nbsp;activate them, simply open the package, shake the warmers up&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit, and then put them in&nbsp;your pockets.</p><p><h2>12. In&nbsp;schools, they have a&nbsp;parent patrol.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec0/eec/36409e573f94b07fb5db73f9df.jpg><p>“School parent police”</p><p>Every day, 2&nbsp;parents inspect the schools: they <a href=#>watch</a> the educational process and make sure everything is&nbsp;alright. Also, parents taste the school food in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;see how well their children are fed. When fathers and mothers patrol the school, they put on&nbsp;the uniform, and they have a&nbsp;schedule of&nbsp;things to&nbsp;do&nbsp;and when they should do&nbsp;them. There is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;special room where they can rest during their break.</p><p><h2>13. Korean parents always follow their children.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/67a/fb4/4b35e25ca79c924bd76db4b6af.jpg><p>Very often, in&nbsp;Korean families, the fathers work and the mothers raise the children: and they dive into this process so&nbsp;deeply that they lose their own lives and personalities. It&nbsp;doesn’t matter what their child does, the mother always has to&nbsp;take an&nbsp;active part in&nbsp;everything.</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=#>blogger</a> that has been living in&nbsp;Korea for a&nbsp;long time tells this story, “Before, my&nbsp;daughter used to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the mountains alone and now&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;with her everywhere.” She was asked recently, “Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;true that you are not adopted?” Koreans think that a&nbsp;real mother can’t be&nbsp;that indifferent to&nbsp;her children and let them go&nbsp;out on&nbsp;their own." After this, the blogger had to&nbsp;accompany her daughter everywhere, even to&nbsp;the shooting of&nbsp;the show that her daughter starred&nbsp;in.</p><p><h2>14. They don’t need total silence and darkness to&nbsp;sleep.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/086/f8b/e7be8850edb55637a67a995442.jpg><p>Korean children are <a href=#>not put</a> in&nbsp;beds in&nbsp;perfectly quiet and dark rooms. They are taught to&nbsp;fall asleep in&nbsp;light and noisy rooms, because this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;make their nervous system stronger. When they become adults, they can restore some energy, even if&nbsp;they only have a&nbsp;little bit of&nbsp;time, like for example when they are on&nbsp;a&nbsp;train or&nbsp;a&nbsp;bus. Koreans can sleep pretty much anywhere, in&nbsp;any conditions.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these things would you like to&nbsp;have in&nbsp;your country?</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in September 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH53ecWamq2rXZavsMHTZqqoraSdeqy70Z6YZqyYlsFuss6rnKKfnpq%2FtHnHmq2eZZ6aw6a%2BjKGcmqqUYryneZZybWpqZGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kaitlin-olson-hacks-emmys-1236102640.html><span>←</span><span>TV Academy Voters, Take Note!
