These can range from derogatory gestures and constant criticism to&nbsp;ironic comments, name-calling, and disapproval. These are all forms of&nbsp;behavior that don’t really have a&nbsp;positive impact on&nbsp;our well-being. However, while we&nbsp;can’t prevent others from acting this way, the way we&nbsp;react when these things happen can make a&nbsp;difference.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>would like to&nbsp;share some tips with you on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;get around this type of&nbsp;attitude without creating conflict.</p><p><h2>1. Avoid turning to&nbsp;anger.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/90c/61a/0d3ae15b34b984a92bc5f2c06d.jpg><p>For some people, their first reaction after facing a&nbsp;belittling attitude may be&nbsp;to&nbsp;get angry, but that also says a&nbsp;lot about&nbsp;us. It&nbsp;could actually be&nbsp;the most common reaction because we&nbsp;perceive this as&nbsp;a&nbsp;threatening attitude. But as&nbsp;you might suspect, it’s also exactly what <a href=#>we&nbsp;shouldn’t do</a>. For one, anger leaves&nbsp;us in&nbsp;a&nbsp;vulnerable state. That’s because we’re showing that the other person has succeeded at&nbsp;belittling&nbsp;us. And secondly, anger also leads to&nbsp;more conflict. When acting out of&nbsp;anger, we’re not really thinking clearly, and we&nbsp;could end up&nbsp;becoming the very thing that made&nbsp;us feel bad in&nbsp;the first place.</p><p><h2>2. Keep your distance from the situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/221/ba9/1988ae5523a7754cbc3fd68ff0.jpg><p>Sometimes, people aren’t really aware of&nbsp;their own behavior, so&nbsp;they might make negative comments that can change other people’s positive attitudes without even realizing they’re doing&nbsp;so. In&nbsp;fact, they might just be&nbsp;projecting their own fears and prejudices onto&nbsp;us. While it’s not recommended to&nbsp;simply allow that to&nbsp;happen, doing something about it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;easier said than done. That’s because maybe the way to&nbsp;go&nbsp;in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;situation is&nbsp;to&nbsp;simply <a href=#>accept</a> that what that person says speaks about the situation he&nbsp;or&nbsp;she is&nbsp;facing, but not necessarily about yours. By&nbsp;doing&nbsp;so, you will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;have greater <a href=# title=empathy data-link=tag>empathy</a> for the other person and won’t let their comments hurt you.</p><p><h2>3. Take your time to&nbsp;respond.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d42/036/f895c6579e846d045d03f87ae3.jpg><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;reacting, <a href=#>time</a> is&nbsp;precious. When you feel that a&nbsp;comment or&nbsp;action made by&nbsp;another person has offended you, the best thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;take a&nbsp;deep breath and let some time pass before reacting. Doing that will give you more perspective on&nbsp;what just happened and could help you make better decisions. Instead of&nbsp;coming back viscerally, you might just take the high road and give a&nbsp;peaceful response to&nbsp;such a&nbsp;negative comment.</p><p><h2>4. Accept or&nbsp;reject an&nbsp;insult, but always in&nbsp;a&nbsp;friendly way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b7/95d/082c49562b8ce12d6e98199854.jpg><p>Some people tend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very critical, use hurtful nicknames, or&nbsp;point out other people’s physical or&nbsp;personal traits in&nbsp;an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;provoke some kind of&nbsp;reaction or&nbsp;level of&nbsp;discomfort. However, it’s up&nbsp;to&nbsp;us to&nbsp;decide how we&nbsp;take those comments and react to&nbsp;them. To&nbsp;avoid any conflict and neutralize these types of&nbsp;aggression, you can use the following <a href=#>2&nbsp;options</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Accept the comment</strong>: Let the person in&nbsp;question know, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;calm manner, that what he&nbsp;or&nbsp;she is&nbsp;saying is&nbsp;true and that you’re fine with that.</li><li><strong>Deny the comment</strong>: Still, with a&nbsp;positive, kind but assertive approach, let the other person know that what they’re saying is&nbsp;wrong, but it&nbsp;doesn’t bother you.</li></ul><p><h2>5. Ask for an&nbsp;explanation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/215/5c8/1a900e5373a26122e6270666fd.jpg><p>At&nbsp;times, insults are not so&nbsp;clear and recognizable, and they can even be&nbsp;disguised as&nbsp;compliments, but that doesn’t mean we&nbsp;can’t put a&nbsp;halt to&nbsp;these, even in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;situation. All you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=#>ask</a> for an&nbsp;explanation as&nbsp;to&nbsp;why the person said what they said or&nbsp;what they meant by&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;the best case scenario, it&nbsp;wasn’t meant as&nbsp;an&nbsp;insult, and all of&nbsp;this was just a&nbsp;misunderstanding, But if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;insult, you can at&nbsp;least open up&nbsp;and have a&nbsp;conversation in&nbsp;a&nbsp;friendly way instead of&nbsp;just generating resentment.</p><p><h2>6. Ignore the person that’s bullying you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/211/07b/b1429d528bb6ed2675d334f5b8.jpg><p>Here’s another <a href=#>useful tip</a> to&nbsp;keep in&nbsp;mind when someone has overstepped their boundaries and you feel disrespected: simply ignore them. That way, the other person will probably understand that you are not going to&nbsp;spend time on&nbsp;their offensive or&nbsp;negative comments. It’s also a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;let them know that they had no&nbsp;effect on&nbsp;you. You can even keep the conversation going by&nbsp;omitting the details you found inappropriate. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, by&nbsp;doing this, you’re actually setting boundaries without saying a&nbsp;single word.</p><p><h2>7. Use your sense of&nbsp;humor.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c1/3b8/925832548b87db444de8192f84.jpg><p>Fighting anger with joy and humor can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good alternative at&nbsp;the right time and place, so&nbsp;to&nbsp;speak. Turn microaggressions into comical situations by&nbsp;<a href=#>responding</a> with a&nbsp;joke to&nbsp;the other person. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good way to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;clear that you’re not going to&nbsp;play their little game, and this, in&nbsp;turn, could help ease the tension. However, keep in&nbsp;mind that this could backfire if&nbsp;the other person takes it&nbsp;the wrong way.</p><p><h2>8. Keep a&nbsp;safe distance from toxic people.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c50/e33/fedc675ec699715fa41b8189b7.jpg><p>Sometimes, you’ll simply run into people who are just seeking conflict. Don’t judge them too harshly&nbsp;— after all, at&nbsp;times, it’s&nbsp;us who might not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;control our emotions and end up&nbsp;making something big out of&nbsp;nothing. In&nbsp;either case, the best thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>distance</a> ourselves from these people in&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy way. We&nbsp;can avoid having contact with them for a&nbsp;short period of&nbsp;time, or&nbsp;if&nbsp;we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;meet them, then do&nbsp;so&nbsp;only under certain circumstances so&nbsp;as&nbsp;not to&nbsp;cause a&nbsp;major confrontation. These precautions could help&nbsp;us to&nbsp;maintain our mental health and well-being.</p><p>What is&nbsp;your strategy when you encounter a&nbsp;person who engages in&nbsp;this behavior?
