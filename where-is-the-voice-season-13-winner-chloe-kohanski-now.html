Originally a member of Team Miley, she ended up being stolen by Blake Shelton.</strong> <strong>Since winning the show, the singer changed her stage name to Chloe MK and has started releasing her music independently.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chloe-kohanski-s-journey-on-the-voice>Chloe Kohanski’s Journey on ‘The Voice’</h2><p>Chloe auditioned for The Voice Season 13 with a cover of “The Chain” by Fleetwood Mac. Her powerful voice turned three judges’ chairs — Miley Cyrus, Blake Shelton, and Jennifer Hudson. The singer chose to join Team Miley.</p><p>She made it through the Battles with a duet of “I Am Woman” by Helen Reddy against teammate Iliana Viramontes, but she lost her Knockout to Ashland Craft. However, her performance of “Landslide” by Fleetwood Mac impressed Shelton and Hudson, both of whom wanted to steal her. She chose to join Team Blake.</p><p>Chloe continued in the competition, performing songs such as “Total Eclipse of the Heart” by Bonnie Tyler and “Call Me” by Blondie. She showed off an incredible voice and a cool style, reaching the Top 10 on iTunes for each performance. Her talent took her all the way to the finals, where she was crowned the winner of Season 13.</p><p>After her win, Chloe signed to Republic Records and released her first single “Come This Far,” which she performed at the Season 14 finale of The Voice. Since then, Chloe has charted her own path in the industry.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>‘THE VOICE’ WINNER CHLOE KOHANSKI IS NOW CHLOE MK, AND SHE’S GOING ON TOUR</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-chloe-mk-doing-now>What Is Chloe MK Doing Now?</h3><p>In 2019, Chloe changed her <a href=#>stage name to Chloe MK</a> (stylized in lowercase as chloe mk) and went on tour with artist Sizzy Rocket. She also started putting out new music, starting with the single “To Be Young.” The same year, she put out an EP titled Fantasy.</p><p>Chloe also updated her personal style, showing off more grungy looks on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. She even sells guitar pick necklaces on <a href=# class=broken_link>her website</a>. Her new persona is distanced from her time on The Voice, as her covers from the show (as well as her single “Come This Far”) only appear under her old name on Spotify.</p><p>Then last November, Chloe independently released a full-length album called All the Same All OK. The singer shared in <a href=#>an interview</a> that she’ll be releasing music through her new vanity label Special Baby. She also talked about her journey to becoming a more independent artist.</p><p>“I think a lot of artists start out doing their own thing their own way and build up to getting signed. But I started with the big, and now I’m going back to the homegrown DIY,” Chloe, now 28, shared, adding, “I have no regrets about how I got to where I am now, and I get so excited when I think about the music I am making moving forward.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1334784520-e1644264802850.jpg alt="Simon Cowell Hospitalized with Broken Arm After Second Electric Bike Accident" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>chloe kohanski</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGcq51dnsBuwMeeZK%2BnmZiybr%2FEmqqopl1mgG7DyKelnqpdmLWtu8RmoqigkaPArLWMp6awZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./les-regions-au-chevet-de-la-pac.html><span>←</span><span>Les rgions au chevet de la PAC</span></a>
