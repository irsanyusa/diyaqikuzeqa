During the episode, judge Simon Cowell finally hit his Golden Buzzer for his own act, Sainted.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-hits-golden-buzzer-on-agt-fantasy-league>Simon Cowell Hits Golden Buzzer on AGT: Fantasy League</h2><p>Sainted is a trap choir that competed on Season 18 of AGT, making it to the Semifinals. They’re back for Fantasy League, competing on Simon Cowell’s team. Ahead of their performance, they waited for clearance to sing “Purple Rain” by Prince.</p><p>Eventually, the group received the exciting news that Prince’s estate had given them permission to perform the song, which celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. Their performance didn’t disappoint, as they received a standing ovation from the judges.</p><p>The performance sparked Mel B to tell Cowell, “I really don’t like you,” since he has such a great act on his team. It was also Cowell’s turn to hit the Golden Buzzer, which he ended up doing for Sainted. They’ll go straight to the Fantasy League Finals on his team. Cowell called the performance “incredible.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIMON COWELL ATTEMPTED TO CHANGE THIS RULE ON ‘AGT: FANTASY LEAGUE’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-other-acts-went-through>What Other Acts Went Through?</h3><p>During Monday’s show, the audience also voted for five acts to go through to the Semifinals. One of those acts was AGT: All-Stars winner Aidan Bryant on Heidi Klum’s team, who performed a stunning aerial routine set to “California Dreaming.” Mel B called it “perfection.”</p><p>Also going through on Klum’s team is Darci Lynne, the young ventriloquist who won Season 12 of AGT. She returned with her puppet Petunia but surprised the judges but playing the electric guitar. Although Mel wasn’t a fan of this new style, the audience apparently loved it enough to send her through.</p><p>Season 18 runner-up Anna Deguzman also earned a place in the Semifinals on Howie Mandel’s team for her fun magic routine, while Mel B’s BGT dance group Ghetto Kids also made it through. Last but not least, Cowell’s act Musa Motha earned a spot in the Semifinals <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for his dance routine</a>.</p><p>What did you think of this week’s episode of AGT: Fantasy League?
