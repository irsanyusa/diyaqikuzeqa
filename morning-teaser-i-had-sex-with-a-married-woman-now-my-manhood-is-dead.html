She told me she had fallen in love with me and would not want me to stay away from her.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>That weekend, she came to my house and stayed till Sunday when she left. That was when I knew she was a married woman with three kids. She told me she was having issues with her husband who never appreciated her and starved her of sex.</p><p>She added that all she wanted was a man who would be willing and Before she left, she gave me a huge amount of money and promised me more as long as I was there for her.</p><p>In my stupidity, I thought I had found a meal ticket and what would I stand to lose? Was it not just to keep having sex with her?</p><p>How wrong I was. Barely six months into the adulterous affair, I got a text message from a man who claimed to be her husband, warning me to stay away from his wife or I would not end up well.</p><p>The next time Amaka came, I showed her the message and she confessed that her husband had gone through her messages and found out we were dating. But she assured me that there was nothing to fear as her husband was just blowing hot air.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But not long after that, the man proved himself. It happened when my fiancee who had been in school, came to visit me. When it was time to have sex, I noticed that my manhood refused to get erect no matter what she did to me.</p><p>I attributed it to work stress but the next time, it was still the same. I became worried because my manhood had never failed me. Tried as much as we did, it would not get up.</p><p>A few days later, I went to see my doctor and after running a test on me, the doctor said there was nothing wrong with me and advised I should not worry about it as that could cause more anxiety.</p><p>It is now getting to four months since the problem started and my fiancee who could not take it any longer dumped me.</p><p>I have taken different drugs, gone to prostitutes to see if my manhood would rise but to no avail. In my desperation, I went to a native doctor who told me the husband of the woman I slept with had 'locked' my manhood and there was was nothing he could do.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>I have been running from pillar to post in search of a solution but nothing has changed.</p><p>Is there anyone out there who can be of help?</p><p>Emmanuel."</p><p>Dear readers, on <a href=# id=8a771722-2c78-5a4a-ab63-cf5ee00a4a6e>Morning Teaser</a> today, we want you to help this young man with some advice on what he should do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02ikqKqenruoedOemKydomK2brTAnWSsnahixKrAx2aYZqWRp7%2BqscNmrqilkaN6r7vWZqSyZZ2Wu6m7zp1koqtdmbKisI5yr25wYJl%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./august.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened in August 2014</span></a>
