The queens took part in an epic challenge dedicated to American Horror Story. The episode saw some of the queens step up and rise to the occasion like the next Supreme.</strong> <strong>Others simply fell flat.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rupaul-s-drag-race-all-stars-queens-channel-american-horror-story-characters>‘RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars’ Queens Channel ‘American Horror Story’ Characters</h2><p>For <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this week’s Maxi Challenge,</a> each of the remaining queens chose to portray a character from the American Horror Story franchise. Angela Bassett, the star of Ryan Murphy’s franchise, stopped by to give the queen’s advice.&nbsp;They were set to perform a skit called Rumerican Horror Story: Coven Girls.</p><p>Kylie Sonique Love battled Ginger Minj for the lead role inspired by Jessica Lange. Kylie ultimately got the role after a nail-biting game of rock-paper-scissors. At first, it was interesting to see how Kylie adapted to the role. She went from being timid to totally opening up and giving it her all.</p><p>Eureka O’Hara took on Cathy Bates’ character, the bearded woman from American Horror Story: Freak Show. Jan shined as the character inspired by Glee’s Lea Michele. This role was tailor-made for Jan who is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">coming off of a rough week.</a> She stole the show in the skit saying “the only queen I bow down to is Idina Menzel.” A’keria C. Davenport had quite the opposite experience this week with the task of taking on the human voodoo doll.</p><p>Ra’Jah&nbsp;O’Hara and Trinity K. Bonet took on Sarah Paulson’s role as conjoined twins. Their roles were also inspired by some of Bassett’s characters throughout the series. Ra’Jah really struggled to embody the character. The pressure was on because Emma Roberts served as the guest judge for this episode.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-an-underdog-backflips-her-way-through-the-lip-sync>An Underdog Backflips Her Way Through the Lip-Sync</h2><p>The runway category this week is “Oh My Goth.”&nbsp;Kylie went for a super sexy barely-there latex outfit. Ginger wore a black lace dress and carried a voodoo doll.&nbsp;Eureka wore a 16th-century leather bodice with a see-through skirt. Ra’Jah went back to the basics with a lace bustier and pants. A’keria wore a huge headpiece and a dress with spikes all over it. The highlight of the runway was honestly Jan’s tiny coffin backpack.</p><p>Michelle Visage felt like Ra’Jah could have given more during the skit. She didn’t like the voice she chose to portray the character with. She advised her to take direction and advice better. The judges loved A’keria’s look but Ross Mathews felt her performance was monotone.&nbsp;</p><p>The judges raved over Jan’s performance and runway look. In the end, it was Kylie who really captured their attention this week. It took a while for Kylie to unleash the performer inside of her and really let go. Mathews was happy to see Kylie really reach for it. Kylie did take the judge’s advice from last week to step it up.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Kylie won her first challenge ever on RuPaul’s Drag Race.&nbsp;Ra’Jah and A’keria are in the bottom two this week. Manila Luzon was revealed to be the lip-sync assassin. Kylie and Manila put on a sexy performance of Christina Aguilera’s “Dirrty.” Kylie dominated the performance with about five backflips and splits. She really brought some magic to the stage and showed everyone why she is an All Star. Kylie won the lip-sync and sent A’keria home.&nbsp;</p><p>Kylie has been one of the internet favorites coming onto the season. To finally see her win a challenge has been a long time coming. We still do not know what kind of twist the eliminated queens will face. Hopefully, next week RuPaul will give viewers a little more information about it.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-93392650.jpg alt="Donny Osmond is Hiding Free Tickets to His Las Vegas Residency" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race all stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570a6nmq2cqHqlvsCgZKuZk5p6orjLZqqtmaKoeqix06xkrKifpLi6edaiq6FlkaKys7XCmqVmoJ%2Bnv7C%2BjKyrqKqpYrCprculnKeflWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dr-semmelweis-review-mark-rylance-1235669521.html><span>←</span><span>'Dr. Semmelweis' Review: Mark Rylance Outshines a Rote Bio-Drama</span></a>
