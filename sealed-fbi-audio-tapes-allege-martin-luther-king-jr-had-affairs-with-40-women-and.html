Business Insider has contacted The King Center for comment on the report, but is yet to receive a response.</p><p>The tapes were made as part of <a href=# id=55a11a61-a01e-3bb7-aed6-752dd2889db0>an illegal FBI surveillance project that began in 1955</a> and continued until King was assassinated in 1968. The FBI was trying to gather negative information about King in hopes of using it to discredit him. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was personally obsessed with bringing down King.</p><p>Given that context and given Garrow's lack of access to the tapes themselves, in addition to the fact that the Standpoint article has yet to be published Garrow's claims raise questions about the accuracy of the evidence and the motives of the FBI agents who created the documents. In a separate article describing the magazine's rationale for publishing the story, Standpoint's acting editor Michael Mosbacher says <a href=# id=1483a5f1-95be-3969-accb-297696070c2d>Garrow's work was previously rejected by The Guardian, The Atlantic and The Washington Post</a> . A number of unnamed conservative magazine in the US also shied away. Mosbacher does not explain why they rejected it, although he implies they felt it was too controversial.</p><p>However, Garrow's 1986 biography of King won the Pulitzer Prize, so his new material will be difficult to ignore.</p><p>Garrow writes that the FBI bugged two lamps in King's room at the Willard Hotel, Washington, in January 1964, the Times said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="Dr. Martin Luther King I Have a Dream"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/fT8ktktTURBXy9jODAzOThmZC1iOTJlLTQ4ZGUtODZiNy1lNjA5MDE0NTVmYjUucG5nkZUCzQMWzQGLwsM></span><p>According to the Times, a memo accompanying the tape describes how King "looked on and laughed" as a pastor of Baltimore's Cornerstone Baptist church allegedly raped a woman in the hotel room. <a href=# id=fca38f45-9f5d-36af-a8e2-222624392c64>The pastor died in 1991.</a></p><p>The FBI documents describe a conversation in which King "discussed which women among the parishioners would be suitable for natural and unnatural sex acts," the Times wrote, referring to Garrow's article.</p><p>"When one of the women protested that she did not approve, the Baptist minister immediately and forcibly raped her," the Times wrote, quoting the FBI documents.</p><p>Garrow notes the FBI agents did not intervene during the alleged rape.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-246cd32b-8d3b-4e35-8a06-075342f3e880 data-caption="MLK quote 05"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/TmOktktTURBXy84ZTdlNWIyOS05OGViLTQ0ZDktOGIwYy0wODA0ZjU0MWYwOTgucG5nkZUCzQMWzQGMwsM></span><p>According to Garrow's article, which quotes the documents: "At the same hotel the following evening, King and a dozen other individuals "participated in a sex orgy"."</p><p>"When one of the women shied away from engaging in an unnatural act, King and several of the men discussed how she was to be taught and initiated in this respect.
