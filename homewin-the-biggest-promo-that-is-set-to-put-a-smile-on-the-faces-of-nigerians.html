In the midst of all of these happenings, the common man is the most affected, as he is the one that suffers the direct impact of these scarcity in the form of price hikes in the cost of food, transportation and other basic amenities which have gone up over 300%. Survival has become a war – more vicious than the Russia – Ukraine war, as businesses are packing-up daily and the few still standing are unable to pay salaries. Landlords are constantly harassing tenants on a daily basis with outrageous cost of housing but an end has finally come.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-83114947-600e-4541-b65c-d12be43d895b data-caption="Homewin, the biggest promo that is set to put a smile on the faces of Nigerians"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/0hwktkqTURBXy9kNGY5MThlZmQxMzVjNGM0NDE1ZGI0YzQxZDViMTYyMy5qcGVnkZUCzQLuzQLtwsM></span><p>For the first time in a long while, Nigerians can now dream of becoming a Landlord in Lagos and win other amazing prizes with just Five Hundred naira (N500) as HOMEWIN, Nigeria’s biggest promo ever launches on May 1st, 2022!</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8f0d0402-2efc-4249-b334-2e03334e34ea data-caption="Homewin, the biggest promo that is set to put a smile on the faces of Nigerians"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/eEmktkqTURBXy9jOTU5MmEwMzhhYTk5YzRhMzk3Y2ZjMDQ2YjU2MzZkMy5qcGVnkZUCzQMWzQMWwsM></span><p>Homewin is giving Nigerians equal opportunity to change their story and transform their destiny with just N500!

According to the Group Managing Director, Mr. Sijibomi Ogundele spoke about why he conceived the idea of Homewin;</p><p>“In December 2020 while distributing Christmas hampers on the streets of Lagos, I bumped into a pregnant lady hawking her wares around Maryland, with a very big stomach. The total value of her merchandise is below N3000 and no matter how much profit she makes, it will never get her out of poverty! I decided to support her and give her child a lifetime scholarship but unfortunately, she lost the child. This inspired me to create an avenue to impact the lives of every Nigerian and give them an equal opportunity to be part of a promo that can get them out of poverty with as little as N500. This was how Homewin was born!</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>For us at Homewin, we see it as the stock market of the common man because it gives Nigerians the opportunity to convert N500 into N50,000,000 in 100 days! Our goal is to make 10 Nigerians Landlord in the space of one year.”</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-d1c52c60-0ac7-4fe3-9114-2ef47d26428d data-caption="Homewin, the biggest promo that is set to put a smile on the faces of Nigerians"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/nBjktkqTURBXy8zNzBkYTUxNTVkYmZkNzQ5NzU0NGE2MGZjMjE2YTBiMi5qcGVnkZUCzQFuzQFAwsM></span><p>Set to launch on the 1st of May 2022, Nigerians in all parts of the country are super excited and very expectant to start winning.
