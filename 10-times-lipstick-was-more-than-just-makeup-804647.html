It’s called the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lipstick</a> Effect.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> dove into history to&nbsp;look for more such examples of&nbsp;when lipstick was more than just a&nbsp;fashion tool. Its journey from then to&nbsp;now makes for a&nbsp;fascinating insight into the past.</p><p><h2>1. Cleopatra’s red lips came from crushed beetles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ef/b47/fbea2d53fdadc61d9d8b84983b.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cleopatra</a> was not just the epitome of&nbsp;feminity and fashion, she was a&nbsp;powerful, educated Egyptian queen in&nbsp;her own right. Lover to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Julius Caesar</a>, she looked her royal part and had lipstick and other <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cosmetics</a> specially crafted for her.</p><p>Unlike the beeswax and color pigments of&nbsp;today, <a href=# title=Cleopatra data-link=tag>Cleopatra</a> had to&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;earthier elements. Her lipsticks included crushed carmine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bugs</a> and ants to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;deeply pigmented hue&nbsp;— enough for historians and artists alike to&nbsp;still talk eloquently about her beauty.</p><p><h2>2. Women of&nbsp;ill-repute in&nbsp;Greece had to&nbsp;wear lipstick to&nbsp;set them apart from respectable women.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/15e/ba6/0bf7475e51bc2a5534df57bedc.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Ancient Greece, women from good and respectable families were discouraged from wearing lip paint. But the “fallen women” were actively encouraged to&nbsp;wear red lipstick to&nbsp;announce their availability to&nbsp;men, even if&nbsp;the lipsticks of&nbsp;that time were made of&nbsp;red dye, sheep sweat, and crocodile feces.</p><p>It&nbsp;was about this time that the first law related to&nbsp;lipsticks came about. Fallen women were decreed by&nbsp;law to&nbsp;wear lipstick in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;set themselves apart from the respectable women of&nbsp;society. If&nbsp;they were caught not wearing lip paint, they were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>punished</a> for posing as&nbsp;ladies in&nbsp;public.</p><p><h2>3. Queen Elizabeth felt lipstick could heal, so&nbsp;she caked on&nbsp;half an&nbsp;inch of&nbsp;the stuff.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/972/1fe/b4eb925377bb89bf1e5d253b61.jpg><p>Queen Elizabeth I&nbsp;reportedly went on&nbsp;her death bed with her lips caked with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lip paint</a>. The Virgin Queen believed that lipstick was magic and had healing powers. Frankly, her makeup could have hastened her end considering it&nbsp;contained ingredients like lead.</p><p>She wore white powder to&nbsp;cover scars from a&nbsp;previous <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disease</a> and is&nbsp;even credited with the invention of&nbsp;making the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lip pencil</a>. At&nbsp;the time, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;sun-dried blend of&nbsp;alabaster and dye.</p><p><h2>4. Later, Queen Victoria felt lipstick was impolite.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b2a/eee/2b84cf50b2851b6c7e973d9d22.jpg><p>Unlike Queen Elizabeth I, <a href=# title="Queen Victoria" data-link=tag>Queen Victoria</a> called makeup <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>“impolite”</a> and Victorians followed their queen by&nbsp;donning a&nbsp;bare-lipped face. At&nbsp;this point in&nbsp;time, lipstick was considered a&nbsp;bane because it&nbsp;let women “inflate their value” by&nbsp;making them appear more beautiful. <a href=# title=Cosmetics data-link=tag>Cosmetics</a> were eschewed in&nbsp;the reign of&nbsp;Queen Victoria&nbsp;— only actresses and fallen women wore lipstick.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, lips were still reddened on&nbsp;the sly. In&nbsp;fact, biting lips or&nbsp;using lip balm with some color would sneak&nbsp;in.</p><p><h2>5. During WWII, female marines wore red lipstick as&nbsp;uniform.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b14/54a/27abb1509fbd2590d19ed1d9c9.jpg><p>WWII was not a&nbsp;pleasant time for anyone. But when news broke that good German women eschewed any artifice, the allies went into overdrive.</p><p>Elizabeth Arden created a&nbsp;makeup kit for the female marines to&nbsp;boost morale, and the red in&nbsp;the lipstick went so&nbsp;far as&nbsp;to&nbsp;match the red on&nbsp;the Marine Corps Women’s Reserve uniforms. The women employed in&nbsp;armor and weaponry factories were inspired by&nbsp;advertising and propaganda that used the famous <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Rosie the Riveter</a>. So&nbsp;they too wore <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>red lipstick</a>.</p><p><h2>6. Red lipstick became a&nbsp;symbol for the suffragettes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/487/744/35b6675f7c8f268c06eecc0b72.jpg><p>Women who started a&nbsp;revolution for women’s rights, including the right to&nbsp;vote, were dubbed the suffragettes. The suffrage movement was a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>100-year</a> struggle, beginning in&nbsp;the 1840s but gathering steam later. For many, it&nbsp;was never truly over and is&nbsp;still continued in&nbsp;different forms in&nbsp;many countries.</p><p>The one enduring symbol of&nbsp;the movement was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>red lipstick</a>. For many, it&nbsp;stood for women’s power and the goal of&nbsp;emancipation.</p><p><h2>7. King Edward IV&nbsp;had custom shades made for himself and nobility.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa5/3dc/1ec3375f6f8b9e550a6dc0ef9b.jpg><p>It’s not just women who fell prey to&nbsp;lipstick’s allure. King Edward IV&nbsp;himself wore lipstick and had custom shades made, including one he&nbsp;called “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Raw Flesh</a>” The nobles in&nbsp;his court emulated him, no&nbsp;matter their gender.</p><p>At&nbsp;the same time, in&nbsp;medieval England, peddlers were selling lip rouge pots, claiming all sorts of&nbsp;magic and sorcery.</p><p><h2>8. Actress Sarah Bernhardt shocked all by&nbsp;applying lipstick in&nbsp;public.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/280/38c/ae317a5900984cf0fb541f19b9.jpg><p>Theatre maven Sarah Bernhardt was a&nbsp;big draw for the public. And yet even she shocked the French and created a&nbsp;scandal by&nbsp;applying lipstick in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>public</a>. Around that time, applying lipstick may have been trendy, but it&nbsp;was still considered a&nbsp;private, feminine affair.</p><p>Historians feel her bold move repopularized lipstick. And not just that, it&nbsp;set a&nbsp;precedent for tons of&nbsp;femme fatales on-screen who could titillate by&nbsp;simply applying lipstick and draw attention to&nbsp;themselves.</p><p><h2>9. Martha Washington used pig fat to&nbsp;make lipstick.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d28/cd2/143c395e2697206c168a524c16.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the time when England had Victorian sensibilities, the colonies, as&nbsp;in&nbsp;America, continued applying lipstick with abandon. Martha Washington, the First Lady of&nbsp;America and wife of&nbsp;President George Washington, made her own lip color.</p><p>Admittedly, it&nbsp;sounds stomach-turning. Her lipstick <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recipe</a> used hogs’ lard, spermaceti, alkanet root, almond oil, balsam, raisins, and sugar. While the colonies largely ignored England’s reticence for makeup, not all states stood as&nbsp;one.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 1700s, in&nbsp;Pennsylvania, a&nbsp;marriage could be&nbsp;annulled if&nbsp;the husband discovered that his wife had used lipstick or&nbsp;other cosmetics to&nbsp;appear more beautiful during their courtship.</p><p><h2>10. Audrey Hepburn said, “There’s a&nbsp;shade of&nbsp;red for every woman.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/843/198/b6bbf05446a6b17665553cc58a.jpg><p>Audrey Hepburn was one of&nbsp;the most influential fashion icons of&nbsp;her time. And over the years, her fame and beauty have only grown in&nbsp;the eyes of&nbsp;the beholder.</p><p>A&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;red lipstick, she famously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “There’s a&nbsp;shade of&nbsp;red for every woman.” And while it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;justify anything from a&nbsp;red dress to&nbsp;accessories, one has to&nbsp;admit that there’s something about a&nbsp;woman who confidently wears red lips.</p><p>Have you come across any such interesting tidbits about lipstick?
