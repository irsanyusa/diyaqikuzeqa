In&nbsp;other cases, some celebrities have even declared that the tattoo they removed gave them “bad luck.” These events happen more frequently than we&nbsp;realize, and some celebrities have had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through this situation more than once.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>researched more about celebrities who have covered up&nbsp;or&nbsp;removed some of&nbsp;their tattoos and this is&nbsp;what we&nbsp;found!</p><p><h2>1. Eva Longoria</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f8/b26/5082ff575d9ad571a7421eee40.jpg><p>This actress had <a href=#>several</a> tattoos in&nbsp;honor of&nbsp;her former husband, basketball <a href=#>player</a> Tony Parker. The first one was on&nbsp;her neck, and it&nbsp;said “Nine,” like the number on&nbsp;the jersey the player wore when he&nbsp;played for the NBA’s San Antonio Spurs. Another very visible tattoo she had was the one with the date of&nbsp;their wedding, “July&nbsp;7, 2007” written in&nbsp;Roman numerals (VII-VII-MMVII). It&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;her right wrist, but later on&nbsp;when they divorced, Eva immediately went to&nbsp;remove the artwork that once symbolized her <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> for the French basketball player.</p><p><h2>2. Rumer Willis</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/159/e3b/e86b6b5512977f6cf7c229b533.jpg><p>The daughter of&nbsp;actors Demi Moore and <a href=# title="Bruce Willis" data-link=tag>Bruce Willis</a> decided to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the lion on&nbsp;her left arm because, in&nbsp;her <a href=#>own</a> words, it&nbsp;was “negatively affecting her ability to&nbsp;land acting gigs.” Even for celebrities, work comes first, although she added too: “It&nbsp;just didn’t feel like me&nbsp;anymore, so&nbsp;I just thought to&nbsp;change it&nbsp;up.”</p><p><h2>3. Heidi Klum</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4a1/0c5/2f65a458a0aa131eb63cd1dd12.jpg><p>While she was married to&nbsp;musician <a href=#>Seal</a>, Heidi Klum proudly wore a&nbsp;tattoo on&nbsp;her <a href=#>right forearm</a> with her husband’s name and stars symbolizing their children’s initials. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;she was done with the singer, she went straight to&nbsp;having part of&nbsp;the tattoo removed by&nbsp;laser. Guess which part was removed...</p><p><h2>4. Kaley Cuoco</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ee/356/b9194f543895ea81ea60d281a0.jpg><p>The actress who jumped to&nbsp;fame after playing Penny in&nbsp;The Big Bang Theory had immortalized the date of&nbsp;her <a href=#>wedding</a> with Ryan Sweeting on&nbsp;her back. However, after announcing their divorce, she decided to&nbsp;cover the Roman numerals with a&nbsp;<a href=#>moth-like</a> insect.</p><p><h2>5. Kelly Osbourne</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c0/f25/3ff3c35374bcf80661e42ee0f7.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2010, the host of&nbsp;Fashion Police, a&nbsp;show on&nbsp;the E! Entertainment channel, spoke for the first time about her decision to&nbsp;have some of&nbsp;her 15&nbsp;tattoos removed. Of&nbsp;course, this made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;most <a href=#>tabloid</a> headlines. She even shared the painful <a href=#>process</a>, on&nbsp;her Instagram account, of&nbsp;removing them with a&nbsp;laser treatment she had to&nbsp;undergo. After announcing her decision, some media made lists to&nbsp;<a href=#>rank</a> the tattoos Osbourne had inked on&nbsp;her body. Among them, a&nbsp;piano and the word “Daddy” to&nbsp;honor her famous father, Ozzy Osbourne, <a href=#>lead singer</a> of&nbsp;rock band Black Sabbath. She also had a&nbsp;red <a href=# title=heart data-link=tag>heart</a>, an&nbsp;anchor, the name “Jack” in&nbsp;honor of&nbsp;her brother, the word “Lovely,” a&nbsp;star, skulls, and red wings with a&nbsp;phrase dedicated to&nbsp;her mother.</p><p><h2>6. Megan Fox</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1cd/4d1/31083a55d9b1112de93f80d4b1.jpg><p>The actress decided to&nbsp;completely erase a&nbsp;tattoo honoring <a href=# title="Marilyn Monroe" data-link=tag>Marilyn Monroe</a>. The reason behind her decision? According to&nbsp;some media reports, Megan got rid of&nbsp;the image of&nbsp;this legend of&nbsp;cinema because it&nbsp;<a href=#>attracted negative energy</a> into her life.</p><p><h2>7. Denise Richards</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/955/4c6/89d3d859529223bfa545e3b7e4.jpg><p>The actress was married to&nbsp;actor Charlie Sheen and both had each other’s name tattooed on&nbsp;their ankle and wrist, respectively. However, after 4&nbsp;years, their marriage came to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end, so&nbsp;they decided to&nbsp;wipe the slate clean. Denise, for example, decided to&nbsp;cover up&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;the famous protagonist of&nbsp;Two and a&nbsp;Half Men with a&nbsp;<a href=#>fairy</a>, while he&nbsp;covered up&nbsp;her name by&nbsp;making himself a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;bracelet.</p><p><h2>8. Marc Anthony</h2></p><p>The Puerto Rican singer was married for several years to&nbsp;singer and actress <a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lopez</a>, but after they decided to&nbsp;break&nbsp;up, he&nbsp;went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>cover up</a>&nbsp;her name, which he&nbsp;had tattooed on&nbsp;his right wrist.</p><p><h2>9. Melanie Griffith</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/345/a78/ca2c8451a297a0cd7e257b416b.jpg><p>To&nbsp;celebrate her then husband, Spanish actor Antonio Banderas, Melanie Griffith decided to&nbsp;tattoo a&nbsp;heart on&nbsp;her right arm that had his name on&nbsp;it. However, in&nbsp;2014, once they started their divorce proceedings, the actress decided to&nbsp;completely <a href=#>erase</a> the symbol of&nbsp;the love she had gotten for him.</p><p><h2>10. Colin Farrell</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d99/4fc/62aec0579680815bc39e3e1802.jpg><p>The actor has had several tattoos that, over time, he’s had removed. One of&nbsp;the reasons for completely removing some of&nbsp;his ink was, according to&nbsp;him and in&nbsp;his own <a href=#>words</a>, because he&nbsp;got tired of&nbsp;getting painted in&nbsp;the makeup chair anytime he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;T-shirt. He&nbsp;also added that some of&nbsp;the images that he&nbsp;had imprinted on&nbsp;his skin no&nbsp;longer pleased him and even embarrassed him.</p><p><h2>11. Pamela Anderson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d9/3bc/0cba50570499408fa691ab744d.jpg><p>The famous Baywatch star had a&nbsp;tattoo of&nbsp;barbed wire on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her arms. However, by&nbsp;2014, the actress decided to&nbsp;<a href=#>remove</a> it&nbsp;completely. The meaning of&nbsp;this piece is&nbsp;still relatively unknown. Some presume that it&nbsp;<a href=#>means</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;locked up&nbsp;and others think it&nbsp;symbolizes living a&nbsp;life full of&nbsp;sacrifice.</p><p><h2>12. Chris Zylka</h2></p><p>This actor was engaged to&nbsp;Paris Hilton. They both swore eternal love to&nbsp;each other and he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;honor their promise with a&nbsp;tattoo on&nbsp;his arm. Unfortunately, their relationship came to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end. It&nbsp;took Zylka <a href=#>9&nbsp;months</a> to&nbsp;cover his ex’s name with the image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;gorilla.</p><p><h2>13. Kat Von&nbsp;D</h2></p><p>The famous tattooist had a&nbsp;tattoo that was done in&nbsp;honor of&nbsp;her ex-fiancé, Jesse James, <a href=#>removed</a>. The tattoo was an&nbsp;image of&nbsp;him when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;child. When they announced their separation, Von D&nbsp;began laser sessions to&nbsp;remove all traces of&nbsp;the past.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have any tattoos?
